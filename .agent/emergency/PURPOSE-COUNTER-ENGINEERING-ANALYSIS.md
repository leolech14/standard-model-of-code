## THE FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION

```
We have 13+ subsystems, 11 background services, 28 pipeline stages, 33 roles...

BUT:
  - Did these emerge from coherent design?
  - Or did they grow organically without purpose alignment?
  - Are they a STABLE PARTITION or overlapping chaos?
```

---

## 1. WHAT IS A STABLE PARTITION?

### Definition

A **stable partition** of system purpose means:

```
1. COMPLETE (Totality)
   Every purpose the system serves is covered by exactly one subsystem
   ∀ purpose p: ∃! subsystem S: S covers p

2. DISJOINT (No Overlap)
   No two subsystems serve the same purpose
   ∀ S1, S2: S1 ∩ S2 = ∅

3. COHERENT (Internal Alignment)
   Each subsystem's components all serve the same sub-purpose
   ∀ component c ∈ S: purpose(c) ⊆ purpose(S)

4. STABLE (Doesn't Drift)
   Adding new features doesn't require reorganizing partitions
   Small changes → small effects (locality)
```

### The MECE Principle

```
MECE = Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive

        ┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
        │         SYSTEM PURPOSE                  │
        ├─────────┬─────────┬─────────┬──────────┤
        │   S1    │   S2    │   S3    │   ...    │
        │         │         │         │          │
        │ (no     │ (no     │ (no     │          │
        │  overlap)│ overlap)│ overlap)│          │
        └─────────┴─────────┴─────────┴──────────┘
              ↑
              Complete coverage, no gaps
```

## 2. CURRENT SUBSYSTEM INVENTORY

### The 13 Documented Subsystems

| ID | Name | Claimed Purpose |
|----|------|-----------------|
| S1 | Collider | Semantic code analysis |
| S2 | HSL | Validation framework |
| S3 | analyze.py (ACI) | AI query interface |
| S4 | Perplexity MCP | External knowledge |
| S5 | Task Registry | Work tracking |
| S6 | BARE | Auto-refinement |
| S7 | Archive | Cloud mirroring |
| S8 | Hygiene | Pre-commit gates |
| S9 | Laboratory | Research experiments |
| S9b | Lab Bridge | Wave→Particle bridge |
| S10 | Enrichment | Task promotion |
| S11 | ACI Refinery | Context atomization |
| S12 | Centripetal | Deep analysis |
| S13 | Macro Registry | Recorded patterns |

### Immediate Red Flags

```
⚠️  S9 and S9b share a number (9, 9b) - suggests organic growth
⚠️  S3 and S11 both deal with "context" - overlap?
⚠️  S2 (HSL) and S8 (Hygiene) both "validate" - overlap?
⚠️  S6 (BARE) and S10 (Enrichment) both "improve tasks" - overlap?
⚠️  No S14 - where does POM fit?
```

---

## 3. PURPOSE OVERLAP ANALYSIS

### Validation Purpose

```
WHO VALIDATES?

S2 (HSL)     - "Validation framework"
S8 (Hygiene) - "Pre-commit gates" (validation)
S6 (BARE)    - "Auto-refinement" (implies validation)

OVERLAP: 3 subsystems claim validation
QUESTION: What's the boundary between them?

POSSIBLE PARTITION:
  S8: Syntax validation (fast, local, pre-commit)
  S2: Semantic validation (slow, AI-powered, post-commit)
  S6: Continuous validation (background, autonomous)

IS THIS DOCUMENTED? NO.
```

### Context/AI Purpose

```
WHO HANDLES AI/CONTEXT?

S3 (analyze.py)  - "AI query interface"
S4 (Perplexity)  - "External knowledge"
S9 (Laboratory)  - "Research experiments"
S11 (ACI Refinery) - "Context atomization"
S12 (Centripetal) - "Deep analysis"

OVERLAP: 5 subsystems claim AI/context
QUESTION: What's the boundary?

POSSIBLE PARTITION:
  S3: Query routing (the front door)
  S4: External data source (Perplexity)
  S9: Experimental research (hypothesis testing)
  S11: Context preparation (chunking, ranking)
  S12: Deep analysis mode (multi-round)

IS THIS DOCUMENTED? PARTIALLY.
```

### Task Management Purpose

```
WHO MANAGES TASKS?

S5 (Task Registry) - "Work tracking"
S6 (BARE)          - "Auto-refinement" (updates tasks?)
S10 (Enrichment)   - "Task promotion"
S13 (Macro Registry) - "Recorded patterns" (task automation?)

OVERLAP: 4 subsystems touch tasks
QUESTION: What's the boundary?

POSSIBLE PARTITION:
  S5: Storage (the database of tasks)
  S10: Promotion (inbox → active)
  S6: Execution (do the task)
  S13: Learning (record patterns for replay)

IS THIS DOCUMENTED? NO.
```

## 4. MISSING PURPOSES

### What purposes exist but have no clear owner?

```
1. VISUALIZATION
   - collider_report.html exists
   - 3D graph rendering exists
   - No subsystem owns "visualization"
   - Scattered across Collider output

2. DOCUMENTATION
   - 749 markdown files
   - No subsystem manages docs
   - No doc generation pipeline
   - CONTEXTOME mentions it but doesn't own it

3. TESTING
   - Tests exist in various places
   - No subsystem owns "test orchestration"
   - S8 (Hygiene) only does pre-commit

4. DEPLOYMENT
   - Archive (S7) does cloud mirroring
   - But no deployment subsystem
   - No CI/CD owner

5. CONFIGURATION
   - Config files scattered
   - analysis_sets.yaml, semantic_models.yaml, etc.
   - No config management subsystem
```

## 5. THE REALM PARTITION

### Is Particle/Wave/Observer a Stable Partition?

```

└───────────────────┴───────────────────┴────────────────────────────┘

ANALYSIS:
  Particle: 1 subsystem (Collider)
  Wave: 8 subsystems
  Observer: 5 subsystems

IMBALANCE: Wave has 8x more subsystems than Particle
QUESTION: Is Particle under-partitioned or Wave over-partitioned?
```

### Particle Decomposition

```
Collider alone does:
  - AST parsing (tree-sitter)
  - Atom classification
  - Purpose detection
  - Graph analytics
  - Visualization generation
  - Report generation

SHOULD these be separate subsystems?
  - Parser (S1a)
  - Classifier (S1b)
  - PurposeEngine (S1c)
  - GraphAnalyzer (S1d)
  - Visualizer (S1e)
  - Reporter (S1f)

OR is the 28-stage pipeline the right internal structure?
```

### Wave Decomposition

```
Wave has 8 subsystems but many overlap.

COULD consolidate to:
  - QueryEngine (S3 + S11 + S12)
  - KnowledgeSource (S4 + S9)
  - Validator (S2)

3 instead of 8?
```

---

## 6. THE PURPOSE FIELD PARADOX

```
PROJECT_elements exists to DETECT PURPOSE in code.

But does PROJECT_elements itself have coherent purpose?

The Purpose Field can compute:
  - coherence_score
  - purpose_entropy
  - is_god_class

WHAT IF we run Purpose Field on PROJECT_elements itself?

Prediction:
  - High entropy in Wave realm (8 overlapping subsystems)
  - Low coherence (subsystems don't align)
  - God classes (Collider does too much)
```

---

## 7. ORGANIC GROWTH EVIDENCE

### Naming Inconsistencies

```
S9 and S9b  - Why "b"? Added later without planning
HSL, BARE, ACI - Acronyms that need explanation
analyze.py - Named after action, not purpose
```

### Location Inconsistencies

```
Tools scattered across:
  - .agent/tools/
  - wave/tools/
  - wave/tools/ai/
  - wave/tools/ai/aci/
  - particle/tools/

No clear principle for what goes where.
```

### Duplication Evidence

```
boundary_analyzer.py exists in TWO places:
  - wave/tools/maintenance/boundary_analyzer.py
  - wave/tools/ai/boundary_analyzer.py

gemini_status.py exists in TWO places:
  - wave/tools/ai/gemini_status.py
  - wave/tools/maintenance/gemini_status.py
```

## 8. PROPOSED STABLE PARTITION

### Option A: Purpose-Based (3 Realms, Refined)

```

### Option B: Data-Flow-Based

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                           DATA FLOW                                  │

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Option C: Keep Current but Define Boundaries

```
Document EXPLICIT boundaries:

S2 (HSL) validates: Semantic correctness via AI
S8 (Hygiene) validates: Syntactic correctness via rules
  → BOUNDARY: AI vs rules

S3 (analyze.py) routes: Queries to appropriate tier
S11 (ACI Refinery) prepares: Context for queries
  → BOUNDARY: Routing vs preparation

etc.
```

---

## 9. RECOMMENDATIONS

### Before Turning On Services

```
1. AUDIT: Run purpose detection on PROJECT_elements itself
   - Identify god classes (Collider?)
   - Identify orphan modules (no clear purpose)
   - Measure coherence across subsystems

2. DOCUMENT: Write explicit boundary definitions
   - What S2 does that S8 doesn't
   - What S3 does that S11 doesn't
   - etc.

3. CONSOLIDATE: Merge overlapping subsystems
   - Consider: S9 + S9b → S9
   - Consider: S11 + S12 → S11
   - Consider: S6 + S10 → S6

4. SPLIT: Break apart god classes
   - Collider internal stages → separate modules?
   - Or keep pipeline but document boundaries
```

### The Counter-Engineering Test

```
For each subsystem S, ask:

1. What SINGLE purpose does S serve?
   - If answer requires "and", it's not single

2. What other subsystem could serve this purpose?
   - If answer is "none", good
   - If answer is "S2 also does this", bad

3. If S disappeared, what would break?
   - If answer is "nothing", S is orphan
   - If answer is "everything", S is god class

4. If S doubled in size, would it still be coherent?
   - If yes, good boundary
   - If no, needs splitting
```

---

## 10. IMMEDIATE ACTIONS

### Action 1: Self-Analysis

```bash
# Run Collider on PROJECT_elements itself
./pe collider full . --output .collider

# Check purpose coherence
python3 -c "
import json
with open('.collider/unified_analysis.json') as f:
    d = json.load(f)
god_classes = [n for n in d['nodes'] if n.get('is_god_class')]
print(f'God classes found: {len(god_classes)}')
for g in god_classes[:10]:
    print(f'  - {g[\"name\"]}')
"
```

### Action 2: Boundary Documentation

Create `.agent/specs/SUBSYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md`:
- For each pair of potentially overlapping subsystems
- Document: "S_x handles A, S_y handles B, boundary is C"

### Action 3: Consolidation Candidates

Review:
- S9/S9b → merge?
- S11/S12 → merge?
- S6/S10 → merge?

## 12. CONCLUSION

**The current architecture is NOT a stable partition.**

Evidence:
- 3+ subsystems claim "validation"
- 5+ subsystems claim "AI/context"
- Naming inconsistent (S9b, acronyms)
- Locations scattered
- Duplicated files

**Before turning it on:**
1. Self-analyze with Purpose Field
2. Document explicit boundaries
3. Consolidate overlaps
4. Verify coherence

**The machine must pass its own test.**

*This analysis questions the architecture. The answer determines if we fix or rebuild.*
