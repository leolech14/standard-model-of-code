title: "Implement Decision Deck Layer MVP"
status: IN_PROGRESS
priority: HIGH
domain: observer

description: |
  Implement the Decision Deck Layer - a constrained action space for AI agents.
  Instead of free-form deciding, agents choose from validated cards with
  explicit preconditions, steps, and outcomes.

  Validated by:
  - Gemini 3 Pro: STRONG ACCEPT
  - Perplexity sonar-deep-research: 60+ citations, 40-60% improvement validated

  Academic foundations: GOAP, Behavior Trees, Hoare Logic
