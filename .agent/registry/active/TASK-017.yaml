  Build a tool to triage the opportunity inbox:
  1. Score all opportunities with 4D confidence (factual/alignment/current/onwards)
  2. Detect duplicates (opps that match existing tasks)
  3. Categorize by source and type
  4. Generate priority ranking
  5. Support batch archive of low-value items

  Current state: 57 opportunities, 0 scored, many duplicates suspected.

  Deliverables:
  - .agent/tools/triage_inbox.py
  - Triage report for current inbox
  - Archive duplicates (OPP-023 to OPP-057 suspected)

confidence:
  factual: 95      # Inbox EXISTS at .agent/registry/inbox/ with 57 items
  alignment: 100   # Critical missing link in discovery pipeline
  current: 90      # Schema exists (.agent/schema/opportunity.schema.yaml), tools exist
  onwards: 100     # Foundation for auto-discovery (BARE OpportunityExplorer)
  verdict: 90      # min(95, 100, 90, 100)

evidence:
  factual:
    - ".agent/registry/inbox/ contains 57 OPP-*.yaml files"
    - ".agent/schema/opportunity.schema.yaml defines structure"
    - "promote_opportunity.py exists and works"
  alignment:
    - "BARE-Live spec identifies OpportunityExplorer as Phase 4"
    - "Current inbox has 0 scored items - blocking promotion"
  current:
    - "boost_confidence.py provides 4D scoring pattern"
    - "DualFormatSaver available for output"
  onwards:
    - "Enables approval gates (70%+ threshold for promotion)"
    - "Foundation for automated triage in BARE"
