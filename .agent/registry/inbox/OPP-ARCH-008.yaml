title: Create mapping of 47 tools to their owning subsystems
status: pending
priority: P1
effort: S
impact: HIGH
source:
  discovery: Code Archaeology Session 2026-01-26
  evidence:
  - 47 tools in .agent/tools/
  - No documentation of which subsystem owns each
  - Contrast with well-documented ACI module
problem: '47 tools exist with no documentation of ownership.

  When adding features: which tool to modify?

  When debugging: which subsystem is responsible?

  No single source of truth for tool inventory.

  '
current_state: '.agent/tools/ has 47 files

  Some clearly belong to subsystems (deck_*, task_*)

  Some are ambiguous (autopilot.py - S6? S10?)

  No formal mapping exists

  '
solution: "1. Create .agent/specs/TOOL_REGISTRY.yaml:\n   ```yaml\n   tools:\n   \
  \  - name: triage_inbox.py\n       subsystem: S5  # Task Registry\n       purpose:\
  \ \"Move tasks from inbox to active\"\n     - name: deal_cards.py\n       subsystem:\
  \ S10  # Enrichment\n       purpose: \"Draw opportunity cards\"\n   ```\n\n2. For\
  \ each of 47 tools:\n   a. Read docstring/code to understand purpose\n   b. Assign\
  \ to one subsystem\n   c. Document purpose in <10 words\n\n3. Add to LOL.yaml as\
  \ authoritative reference\n"
acceptance_criteria:
- TOOL_REGISTRY.yaml exists
- All 47 tools mapped to subsystems
- Each tool has purpose statement
- Registry linked from LOL.yaml
blocks:
- OPP-ARCH-003
validation_notes: 'AI Validation (2026-01-26) flagged:

  - This should happen BEFORE OPP-ARCH-003 (directory reorganization)

  - Cannot effectively move files without knowing which subsystem owns each

  - Informs the directory structure decisions
