# Opportunity: Audit TODO/FIXME Markers
id: OPP-ARCH-005
title: "Audit and resolve 29 TODO/FIXME markers"
status: pending
priority: P2
effort: M
impact: LOW

source:
  discovery: "Code Archaeology Session 2026-01-26"
  evidence:
    - "29 TODO/FIXME markers found in codebase"
    - "Multilingual comments (Portuguese TODOs)"
    - "Some reference unfinished work from unknown time"

problem: |
  29 TODO/FIXME markers scattered across codebase.
  Some are stale (work already done elsewhere).
  Some are in Portuguese suggesting different contributors.
  No tracking of which TODOs are actually important.

notable_examples:
  - "# TODO: Implementar clone de repo (Portuguese)"
  - "# TODO: Replace with real detector call"
  - "# TODO: Expandir com 50+ repositorios reais"

solution: |
  1. Run: grep -r "TODO\|FIXME" --include="*.py" | grep -v __pycache__
  2. For each marker:
     a. Is work still relevant? Delete if done
     b. Is it a real task? Create opportunity
     c. Is it a wish? Document or delete
  3. Establish policy: TODOs must have ticket/opp reference

acceptance_criteria:
  - Each TODO/FIXME either deleted or linked to opportunity
  - No orphan TODOs older than 30 days
  - Policy documented in CONTRIBUTING.md
