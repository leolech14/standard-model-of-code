title: Delete duplicate SocraticValidator class definition
status: pending
priority: P0
effort: XS
impact: HIGH
source:
  discovery: Code Archaeology Session 2026-01-26
  file: context-management/tools/ai/analyze.py
  evidence:
  - 'Line 1668: class SocraticValidator (first definition)'
  - 'Line 1995: class SocraticValidator (exact duplicate)'
problem: 'The same class is defined twice in analyze.py.

  Python uses the second definition, making lines 1668-1770 dead code.

  This causes confusion and increases file size unnecessarily.

  '
solution: 'Delete lines 1668-1770 (the first SocraticValidator definition).

  Keep lines 1995-2070 (the second definition that Python actually uses).

  Run tests to verify no breakage.

  '
