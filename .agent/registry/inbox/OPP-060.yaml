category: INFRASTRUCTURE
source: "User vision + AEP specification"

description: |
  Implement the Autonomous Enrichment Pipeline that runs on GCP:

  1. Watches .agent/registry/inbox/ for new OPPs
  2. Runs research loops (Gemini + Perplexity + Collider)
  3. Fills knowledge gaps automatically
  4. Computes 4D confidence scores
  5. Auto-promotes to TASK when >= 85% (Grade A)
  6. Maps steps at 85%+ confidence each

  PRINCIPLE: A TASK means VALIDATED, READY TO EXECUTE.

  MVP Scope:
  - Local cron job (hourly) as Phase 1
  - Uses existing analyze.py + loop.py infrastructure
  - Writes enriched data back to registry

evidence:
  spec: ".agent/specs/AUTONOMOUS_ENRICHMENT_PIPELINE.md"
  dependencies:
    - TASK-019 (Gemini caching - required for efficiency)
    - loop.py (Gemini → Perplexity → Gemini workflow)
    - analyze.py (context loading)
    - Collider (codebase analysis)

confidence:
  factual: 92       # Perplexity validated - aligns with production patterns
  alignment: 100    # This IS the mission - autonomous intelligence
  current: 80       # Requires TASK-019 first
  onwards: 100      # Foundation for all future autonomy
  overall: 80       # min() - blocked by TASK-019

verdict: DEFER  # Needs TASK-019 completed first (80% current)

validation:
  perplexity:
    date: "2026-01-23"
    verdict: "VALIDATED - aligns with production AI/ML patterns"
    key_findings:
      - "Continuous enrichment loops - STANDARD"
      - "Multi-stage validation - USED in production"
      - "External validation via Perplexity - INNOVATIVE extension"
    academic_foundations:
      - "Autonomous agent orchestration (procedural reasoning)"
      - "Tree-of-Thought and HTN (task decomposition)"
      - "Self-optimizing pipelines (emerging frontier)"

blocked_by:
  - TASK-019  # Gemini caching required for cost efficiency
