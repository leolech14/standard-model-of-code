**Status:** PROPOSED
**Version:** 1.1
**Date:** 2026-01-23
**Philosophy:** "Worse is Better" - Simple implementations that work beat complex ones that don't

> **CARDINAL RULE: We never delete. Only archive.**

### Traceability Requirements

Every archived file MUST have:

| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Original Path** | Where the file lived before archiving | `.agent/intelligence/truths/history/` |
| **Archive Path** | Where the file now lives | `archive/agent_cuts/2026-01-23/truths_history/` |
| **Archive Date** | ISO 8601 timestamp | `2026-01-23T07:15:00Z` |
| **Archive Reason** | Why it was cut | `DEAD_WEIGHT`, `SUPERSEDED`, `CONSOLIDATED`, `MISPLACED` |
| **Archived By** | Agent or human who performed the cut | `claude-opus-4-5-20251101` |
| **Git Commit** | Commit SHA that performed the archive | `abc123...` |
| **Restore Command** | How to undo if needed | `mv archive/...  .agent/...` |

### PROVENANCE.yaml Schema

```yaml
# archive/agent_cuts/2026-01-23/PROVENANCE.yaml
# Machine-readable archive provenance for forensic traceability

archive_operation:
  id: "CUT-2026-01-23-001"

  operator: "claude-opus-4-5-20251101"
  git_commit: null  # Populated after commit
  plan_reference: ".agent/specs/CUTTING_PLAN.md"

rationale: |
  Bulk-to-lean cutting phase. Removing dead weight, consolidating
  overlapping docs, simplifying state machine. Archive preserves
  full history for potential restoration.

### Versioning Protocol

| Version Event | Action |
|---------------|--------|
| **Initial Archive** | Create `PROVENANCE.yaml` with `v1.0` |
| **Partial Restore** | Increment patch: `v1.1`, log in `restoration_history` |
| **Full Restore** | Archive the archive: `archive/agent_cuts/2026-01-23_RESTORED/` |
| **Re-cut** | New date directory: `archive/agent_cuts/2026-01-24/` |

### Integrity Verification

```bash
# Verify archive integrity (run anytime)
cd archive/agent_cuts/2026-01-23/
for f in $(find . -type f -not -name "PROVENANCE.yaml" -not -name "MANIFEST.md"); do
  sha256sum "$f"
done

# Compare with PROVENANCE.yaml sha256_at_archive values
```

### Recovery Protocol

```bash
# To restore a single file:
mv archive/agent_cuts/2026-01-23/workflows/testing_suite.md .agent/workflows/

# To restore entire archive (undo the cut):
cp -r archive/agent_cuts/2026-01-23/* .agent/
# Then manually move files to correct locations per PROVENANCE.yaml

# Log restoration in PROVENANCE.yaml:
# restoration_history:
#   - date: "2026-01-25T10:00:00Z"
#     file: "workflows/testing_suite.md"
#     reason: "Needed for new experiment"
```

## Executive Summary

PROJECT_elements has completed its **bulk phase** - extensive design documents, multiple registries, ambitious automation specs. Now it's time to **cut** - eliminate redundancy, consolidate overlap, and simplify to a minimal viable system.

**Core Principle:** Design artifacts should not co-mingle with operational artifacts. Move aspirations to roadmaps, keep only what's actively running.

---

## Research Sources

All research auto-saved to `particle/docs/research/perplexity/`:

| Query | Key Insight |
|-------|-------------|
| Registry of Registries patterns | SSOT with YAML > distributed markdown tables |
| Cutting complexity best practices | Delete obsolete code, extract repeated logic, remove redundancy |
| Minimal viable registry patterns | 5 essential fields only: name, version, source, license, deps |
| Format comparison | TOML > YAML > JSON for minimal human-readable configs |

**"Worse is Better" Examples:** `package.json`, `Cargo.toml`, `pyproject.toml` - tiny files that power massive ecosystems.

## The Cutting Audit

### FILES TO ARCHIVE

| File | Archive To | Justification |
|------|------------|---------------|
| `.agent/intelligence/truths/history/*.yaml` | `archive/agent_cuts/2026-01-23/truths_history/` | **DEAD WEIGHT.** Historical snapshots with no consumer. BARE doesn't use them. Only `repo_truths.yaml` matters. |
| `.agent/workflows/testing_suite.md` | `archive/agent_cuts/2026-01-23/workflows/` | **MISPLACED.** Describes a 100+ repo experiment - not core agent workflow. |
| `wave/.agent/orientation/*` | `archive/agent_cuts/2026-01-23/orientation/` | **STALE.** Git shows these as deleted but tracked. Archive properly. |
| `wave/.agent/workflows/publish.md` | `archive/agent_cuts/2026-01-23/workflows/` | **STALE.** Also shows as deleted in git status. |
| `OPEN_CONCERNS.md` (after extraction) | `archive/agent_cuts/2026-01-23/` | **SUPERSEDED.** Content migrated to sprints/README.md and BARE roadmap. |

### FILES TO MERGE

| Merge This | Into This | Justification |
|------------|-----------|---------------|
| `OPEN_CONCERNS.md` (vision parts) | `specs/BACKGROUND_AUTO_REFINEMENT_ENGINE.md` | Consolidate all future-facing design into BARE spec |
| `OPEN_CONCERNS.md` (sprint docs) | `sprints/README.md` (new) | Documentation lives with implementation |
| Multiple registry INDEX.md tables | `.agent/META_REGISTRY.yaml` (new) | Single machine-readable source of truth |

### SIMPLIFICATIONS

#### A. Simplify BARE Spec
- **Current:** 6-processor daemon spec, only TruthValidator runs
- **Action:** Main body = only what's implemented. Move other 5 processors to "Roadmap" section.

#### B. Simplify Task State Machine
- **Current:** `DISCOVERY → SCOPED → PLANNED → EXECUTING → VALIDATING → COMPLETE → ARCHIVED` (7 states)
- **Proposed:** `DISCOVERY → READY → EXECUTING → COMPLETE → ARCHIVED` (5 states)
- **Benefit:** Fewer states, simpler claim logic, lower procedural overhead

#### C. Remove Static Agent Capabilities
- **Current:** `manifest.yaml` lists static agent capabilities
- **Action:** Delete `agents` section. Derive capabilities from `runs/` history instead.

## The Minimal Viable Meta-Registry

### Design Constraints

| Constraint | Value |
|------------|-------|
| File count | **1** (single file) |
| Max lines | **50** |
| Automation | **None** (manually maintained initially) |
| Fields per entry | **3** (path, type, purpose) |
| Health checks | **None** |
| Checksums | **None** |
| **Purpose Alignment** | For entries mapping to a subsystem in `SUBSYSTEM_INTEGRATION.md`, the `purpose` field **MUST** use the exact string from that subsystem's `Purpose` column |

### The File: `.agent/META_REGISTRY.yaml`

```yaml
# .agent/META_REGISTRY.yaml
#
# Minimal index of key project registries and documents. Manually maintained.
# Replaces markdown tables for machine-readable agent discovery.
# Purpose fields ALIGNED with SUBSYSTEM_INTEGRATION.md canonical definitions.

registries:
  # Bootstrap & Configuration
  - path: .agent/KERNEL.md
    type: protocol
    purpose: Agent boot protocol and core principles

  - path: .agent/manifest.yaml
    type: manifest
    purpose: Machine-readable project metadata for tools

  # Strategic & Design
  - path: .agent/SUBSYSTEM_INTEGRATION.md
    type: map
    purpose: Canonical map of subsystem connections

  - path: .agent/specs/
    type: specs
    purpose: System specifications and designs (incl. BARE)

  - path: .agent/sprints/
    type: sprints
    purpose: Sprint definitions and tracking

  # Operational State (Aligned with S5 Task Registry)
  - path: .agent/registry/active/
    type: tasks
    purpose: Work item tracking  # ALIGNED: S5 Task Registry

  - path: .agent/registry/inbox/
    type: inbox
    purpose: Triage inbox for new opportunities

  - path: .agent/runs/
    type: runs
    purpose: Agent work session logs

  # Intelligence Output (Aligned with S6 BARE)
  - path: .agent/intelligence/truths/repo_truths.yaml
    type: truths
    purpose: Background auto-refinement  # ALIGNED: S6 BARE TruthValidator output

  # External Registries (Aligned with S1, S7)
  - path: particle/docs/specs/REGISTRY_OF_REGISTRIES.md
    type: theory
    purpose: Semantic code analysis  # ALIGNED: S1 Collider ontological ground truth

  - path: wave/registry/REGISTRY.json
    type: archive-config
    purpose: Cloud sync  # ALIGNED: S7 Archive/Mirror (GCS)
```

**Total: 11 entries, ~45 lines**

### `META_REGISTRY.yaml` vs. `manifest.yaml`

These two files serve **distinct but complementary roles**:

| File | Role | Question It Answers |
|------|------|---------------------|
| **`manifest.yaml`** | Low-level machine configuration | "How do I configure myself to run?" |
| **`META_REGISTRY.yaml`** | High-level curated table of contents | "Where do I look to find X?" |

**`manifest.yaml`** provides:
- Specific data paths for tools/scripts
- Integration details (secrets, cloud config)
- Validation rules for execution

**`META_REGISTRY.yaml`** provides:
- First-read overview for agents/humans
- Strategic discovery of knowledge sources
- Replaces scattered markdown tables with single index

While some paths overlap, their **intended consumer and purpose differ**. `META_REGISTRY.yaml` is for strategic navigation; `manifest.yaml` is for operational configuration.

### Subsystem Alignment Matrix

Cross-reference between META_REGISTRY entries and SUBSYSTEM_INTEGRATION.md canonical definitions:

| META_REGISTRY Entry | Subsystem ID | Canonical Purpose (from S_I.md) | Type |
|---------------------|--------------|--------------------------------|------|
| `.agent/registry/active/` | S5 | Work item tracking | State |
| `.agent/intelligence/truths/` | S6 | Background auto-refinement | State |
| `particle/docs/specs/REGISTRY_OF_REGISTRIES.md` | S1 | Semantic code analysis | Engine |
| `wave/registry/REGISTRY.json` | S7 | Cloud sync | Utility |
| `.agent/KERNEL.md` | S0 | Bootstrap/Protocol | Config |
| `.agent/manifest.yaml` | S0 | Bootstrap/Protocol | Config |
| `.agent/SUBSYSTEM_INTEGRATION.md` | S0 | Subsystem Integration | Doc |
| `.agent/specs/` | S6 | BARE specifications | Doc |
| `.agent/sprints/` | S5 | Sprint tracking | State |
| `.agent/registry/inbox/` | S5 | Opportunity triage | State |
| `.agent/runs/` | S5 | Session logs | State |

**Validation Rule:** If a META_REGISTRY entry maps to a subsystem, its `purpose` field must match or derive from the subsystem's canonical `Purpose` in SUBSYSTEM_INTEGRATION.md.

```

**Effort:** 20 minutes
**Risk:** None (archive preserves everything with full provenance)

### Phase 2: Create Meta-Registry

```bash
# Create the minimal meta-registry file
# (content as specified above)
```

**Effort:** 10 minutes
**Risk:** None

### Phase 3: Consolidate OPEN_CONCERNS

1. Extract sprint documentation → `sprints/README.md`
2. Extract future vision → append to `specs/BACKGROUND_AUTO_REFINEMENT_ENGINE.md` as "Roadmap" section
3. Archive `OPEN_CONCERNS.md` → `archive/agent_cuts/2026-01-23/OPEN_CONCERNS.md`

**Effort:** 30 minutes
**Risk:** Low (document reorganization, original preserved in archive)

### Phase 4: Simplify State Machine

Update `KERNEL.md` task lifecycle:

```diff
- DISCOVERY → SCOPED → PLANNED → EXECUTING → VALIDATING → COMPLETE → ARCHIVED
+ DISCOVERY → READY → EXECUTING → COMPLETE → ARCHIVED
```

Update `claim_task.sh` to claim `READY` tasks.

**Effort:** 1 hour
**Risk:** Medium (behavior change)

### Phase 5: Trim BARE Spec

Edit `specs/BACKGROUND_AUTO_REFINEMENT_ENGINE.md`:
- Move unimplemented processors to "## Future Roadmap" section
- Main body describes only TruthValidator (what's running)

**Effort:** 30 minutes
**Risk:** Low

## Success Metrics

| Metric | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Files in `.agent/intelligence/truths/history/` | 2+ | 0 (archived) |
| Task states | 7 | 5 |
| Design docs with implementation overlap | 2+ | 0 (consolidated) |
| Machine-readable registry index | 0 | 1 |
| Lines in META_REGISTRY.yaml | N/A | <50 |
| Files in `archive/agent_cuts/2026-01-23/` | 0 | 5+ (preserved history) |

---

## Decision Log

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| **Archive, never delete** | Preserve history; enables recovery; respects past work |
| **Purpose alignment with SUBSYSTEM_INTEGRATION.md** | Single source of truth for subsystem definitions; prevents semantic drift |
| **META_REGISTRY.yaml complements (not duplicates) manifest.yaml** | Different consumers: strategic navigation vs operational config |
| YAML over TOML | Project already uses YAML everywhere; consistency > optimal format |
| No automation initially | "Worse is better" - manual maintenance is fine until it isn't |
| No health checks | YAGNI - add when there's a consumer that needs them |
| Single file | Atomic, easy to version, no assembly needed |
| Directory paths allowed | `.agent/registry/active/` is a valid registry location |
| Archive location: `archive/agent_cuts/` | Centralized, dated, with MANIFEST for context |
| Subsystem ID references (S0-S7) | Enables traceability to canonical subsystem definitions |
