# PROJECT_elements: Self-Portrait

**Generated:** 2026-01-24
**Purpose:** The Standard Model of Code analyzing itself
**Method:** Mapping discovered entities to the 16-level scale

---

## The Revelation

We have 10 subsystems documented (S1-S9b). But between them and the totality lies **connective tissue** - tools, utilities, state - that we called "dark matter."

These aren't orphans. They're **entities seeking their tribe**.

This document maps every discovered entity to its proper level in the scale.

---

## Level Mapping: PROJECT_elements

### L8: ECOSYSTEM - "PROJECT_elements"

The entire repository. Contains multiple systems working together toward a unified purpose: **finding the basic constituents of computer programs**.

```
PROJECT_elements/
├── standard-model-of-code/  (L7: System)
├── context-management/      (L7: System)
├── .agent/                  (L7: System)
├── archive/                 (L7: System - dormant)
├── related/                 (L7: System - external)
└── [root configs]           (L6: Package - governance)
```

**Terminology:** ECOSYSTEM = A cohesive collection of Systems with shared purpose

---

### L7: SYSTEM (formerly "Holon")

Self-contained units that can operate independently but integrate into the larger whole.

| System | Path | Purpose | Status |
|--------|------|---------|--------|
| **Collider** | `standard-model-of-code/` | Analysis engine (THE product) | ACTIVE |
| **Wave** | `context-management/` | AI/Intelligence layer | ACTIVE |
| **Observer** | `.agent/` | Governance/state | ACTIVE |
| **Archive** | `archive/` | Historical preservation | DORMANT |
| **External** | `related/` | Third-party tools | DEPENDENCY |

**Terminology:** SYSTEM = A Holon - autonomous unit with clear boundary and purpose

---

### L6: PACKAGE (Subsystems)

The 10 documented subsystems, plus newly discovered ones:

| ID | Subsystem | System | Path | Purpose |
|----|-----------|--------|------|---------|

**Terminology:** FILE = Module - a single source file with coherent purpose

---

### L4: CONTAINER (Classes/Major Structures)

Classes, large data structures, configuration objects within files.

Examples from Collider (S1):
- `class UnifiedAnalyzer` in `full_analysis.py`
- `class AtomClassifier` in `atom_classifier.py`
- `class TreeSitterEngine` in `tree_sitter_engine.py`

**Terminology:** CONTAINER = Class or major structural unit

---

### L3: NODE (Functions/Methods)

Individual callable units. This is Collider's primary analysis level.

**Terminology:** NODE = Function, method, or callable

---

### L2: BLOCK

Logical blocks within functions (if/else, try/catch, loops).

**Terminology:** BLOCK = Control flow unit

---

### L1: STATEMENT

Individual statements.

**Terminology:** STATEMENT = Single executable line

---

### L0 and below: SYNTACTIC/PHYSICAL

Tokens, characters, bytes, bits. Below our semantic concern.

## Emergent Insights

### 1. The Three-Realm Architecture is Real

```
PARTICLE (Collider)     WAVE (Intelligence)     OBSERVER (Governance)
       S1                   S2, S3, S4              S5, S6, S7, S8
       S9                   S9b, S11, S12           S10
                            S15?                    S13?, S14?
```

### 2. Subsystem Count is Growing

- Started: 10 (S1-S9b)
- Discovered: 3 (S10-S12)
- Emerging: 3 (S13-S15)
- **Total: 16 subsystems** (!)

### 3. The Connective Tissue Has Structure

What we called "dark matter" is actually:
- **State storage** (`.agent/intelligence/`) → Part of Observer
- **Utility functions** (color, size) → Part of respective Systems
- **Coordination tools** (task_registry, sprint) → Part of S5/S6

### 4. Self-Similarity Across Levels

The Ecosystem has Systems has Packages has Modules has Containers has Nodes.
Each level exhibits the same pattern: **purpose-driven units with clear boundaries**.

---

## Next Steps

1. **Formalize S13-S15** or merge their tools into existing subsystems
2. **Update SUBSYSTEM_INTEGRATION.md** to v1.3.0 with new subsystems
3. **Run Collider on PROJECT_elements** to validate node counts at L3-L5
4. **Compare** this self-portrait with external codebases

---

## The Meta-Insight

The Standard Model of Code's first test subject is itself.

We're not just building a tool. We're **growing a theory** by:
1. Defining levels (done: 16 levels)
2. Naming entities (this document)
3. Discovering relationships (SoS map)
4. Validating predictions (Collider output)

The project knowing itself is the first step toward knowing all projects.

*This document is a living portrait. Update as entities are discovered or reclassified.*
