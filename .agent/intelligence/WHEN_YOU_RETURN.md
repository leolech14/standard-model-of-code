# When You Return - Palace Status Report
**Purpose:** What to expect and how to access your knowledge library
**Updated:** 2026-01-27

## WHAT TO EXPECT WHEN YOU COME BACK

### The Palace Maintained Itself

While you were away, 26 butlers kept everything tidy:

```
Filesystem Watcher (if files changed)
    ↓
Detected changes → Waited 5 minutes → Ran wire.py
    ↓
Generated fresh chunks, recorded metrics, updated state
    ↓
Everything validated, timestamped, ready

Cloud Schedulers (4x daily: 00, 06, 12, 18 UTC)
    ↓
Ran socratic-audit-job → Analyzed codebase → Uploaded results
    ↓
Cloud intelligence accumulated

Post-Commit Hooks (if commits happened)
    ↓
Autopilot orchestrated → Enrichment ran → Fabric recorded
    ↓
Task confidence updated, opportunities scored

Background Daemons (LaunchAgents)
    ↓
File watcher monitored, HSL checked health hourly
    ↓
Continuous monitoring maintained
```

**Result:** Knowledge is FRESH, VALIDATED, READY.

## FIRST COMMAND WHEN YOU RETURN

./pe refinery search ".agent/tools/autopilot"
→ Returns all chunks from autopilot.py

# Find chunks from specific type
./pe refinery library
→ Browse by file, see types
```

**By Content:**
```bash
# Semantic search
./pe refinery search "how to add a butler"
→ Searches ALL chunks for relevant code/docs

# Topic search
./pe refinery search "pipeline stages"
→ Finds chunks discussing pipeline
```

## HOW TO READ THE LIBRARY

### Scenario 1: "Show me everything about X"
```bash
./pe refinery search "Communication Fabric" --limit 10 --context
```
- Returns: Top 10 chunks with FULL CONTENT
- Shows: Where it's implemented, discussed, documented

### Scenario 2: "What files should I read?"
```bash
./pe refinery library
```
- Returns: Files ranked by chunk count (most knowledge)
- Top file = most important for understanding

### Scenario 3: "What changed?"
```bash
./pe refinery changes
```
- Returns: Activity log (file changes, wire runs)
- Shows: What the watcher did

### Scenario 4: "Is knowledge fresh?"
```bash
./pe refinery chunks
```
- Returns: Metadata (timestamp, git SHA)
- Quick freshness check

---

## THE COMPLETE WORKFLOW

### When You Return:

**Step 1: Check Palace Status**
```bash
./pe status
```
Shows: Git, autopilot, TDJ summary

**Step 2: Check Refinery Activity**
```bash
./pe refinery report
```
Shows: What happened while away, knowledge freshness, library stats

**Step 3: Query Specific Knowledge**
```bash
./pe refinery search "your topic"
```
Returns: Relevant chunks instantly

**Step 4: Browse Library (Optional)**
```bash
./pe refinery library
```
Browse: All knowledge organized by file

**Step 5: Start Work**
With complete, fresh, organized knowledge at your fingertips.

## WHAT YOU'LL SEE (Examples)

### If Files Changed While Away:
```
Last Updated: 2h ago
Wire pipeline runs: 4
Result: Knowledge regenerated 4 times, stayed fresh
```

### If No Changes:
```
Last Updated: 12h ago (still current)
Wire pipeline runs: 0
Result: Knowledge converged, no wasteful re-processing
```

### If Watcher Had Issues:
```
Activity LOG: No activity logged (watcher may not be running)
Action: Restart with: screen -dmS watcher python3 .agent/tools/filesystem_watcher.py
```

---

## THE LIBRARY AS ORGANIZED KNOWLEDGE

**Think of it as:**

### Dewey Decimal System for Code
- agent_chunks.json = 000-099 (Automation & Orchestration)
- core_chunks.json = 100-199 (Analysis & Theory)
- aci_chunks.json = 200-299 (AI & Context)

### Table of Contents
```
metadata.json = Card catalog (where everything is)
query_chunks.py = Search engine (find by topic)
refinery_report.py = Librarian (organized views)
state_synthesizer.py = Inventory (complete catalog)
```

### Access Methods
- **Search:** Quick lookup by keyword
- **Library:** Browse by file/module
- **Report:** Activity summary
- **Stats:** Complete inventory

---

## HEALTH CHECKS

### Is Refinery Working?
```bash
./pe refinery chunks
# Should show: Generated within last few hours
```

### Is Watcher Running?
```bash
ps aux | grep filesystem_watcher
# Should show: Process active

screen -list
# Should show: watcher (Detached)
```

### Is Knowledge Fresh?
```bash
./pe refinery report
# Check: "Last Updated" should be recent
```

### Can I Query?
```bash
./pe refinery search "test query"
# Should return: Results in <1s
```

---

## IF SOMETHING BROKE WHILE AWAY

### Watcher Not Running:
```bash
screen -dmS watcher python3 .agent/tools/filesystem_watcher.py
```

### Chunks Stale:
```bash
./pe wire --quick
# Regenerates chunks immediately
```

### Knowledge Corrupted (Unlikely - Validation Prevents This):
```bash
# Delete chunks, regenerate
rm .agent/intelligence/chunks/*.json
./pe wire
```

---

## SUMMARY

**When you return:**

1. **Run:** `./pe refinery report`
   - See what happened while away

2. **Check:** Timestamps, activity log
   - Verify butlers worked

3. **Query:** `./pe refinery search "topic"`
   - Access organized knowledge instantly

4. **Browse:** `./pe refinery library`
   - See complete knowledge catalog

**The palace maintains itself. You just harvest the knowledge.**

## 🆕 LATEST SESSION (2026-01-27 Visualization Debug)

### What Happened This Session

**Original Task:** Organize documentation for ChatGPT audit
**Detour:** Visualization unified graph + mouse controls (5 hours)
**Result:** Documentation complete ✅, Visualization partial ⚠️

### Documentation Completed ✅

| Artifact | Location | Status |
|----------|----------|--------|
| INDEX.md | Root | ✅ Front door |
| THEORY_MAP.md | Root | ✅ 479 files mapped |
| AUDIT_MANIFEST.md | Root | ✅ Audit ready |
| PROJECT_METADATA.md | Root | ✅ Timestamps |
| Zips (4) | ~/Downloads/ | ✅ Ready for ChatGPT |

### Visualization Work ⚠️

**Files Modified:** 7 viz modules (540 lines changed)

**Good Fixes (42 lines):**
- Stop selection animation when empty
- Disable PERF_MONITOR auto-start
- Remove REFRESH from 5 animation loops
- Skip redundant opacity updates
- Only transparent when opacity < 1

**Complex Features (498 lines):**
- Unified graph (atoms + files in one graph)
- Crossfade transitions (750ms animated)
- Mouse controls (LEFT=select, RIGHT=rotate, SPACE+LEFT=pan)

**Status:** Code integrated but NOT TESTED by user yet

**Test Build:** `/tmp/final-integrated/output_human-readable_particle_20260127_093531.html`

### Research Artifacts Created (6 docs)

All saved to `docs/research/`:
- UI Projectome (Gemini)
- Performance optimization patterns (Perplexity)
- Animation lifecycle (Gemini)
- HTML generation pipeline (Gemini)
- Minimal fix strategies (Gemini)

### Knowledge Base Built (8 docs in /tmp/)

| Document | Lines | Purpose |
|----------|-------|---------|
| VISUALIZATION_COMPLETE_KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md | 300 | Complete system map |
| VIZ_STATE_FREEZE.md | 200 | Session freeze point |
| COMPLETE_EDIT_TRACE.md | 200 | Every edit traced |
| UI_REFACTOR_COMPLETE_MAP.md | 280 | UI refactor inventory |
| NEXT_STEPS_CONFIDENCE_ASSESSMENT.md | 150 | Action confidence |
| FINAL_STATE_SUMMARY.md | 200 | Test checklist |
| UNIFIED_GRAPH_RESEARCH_NOTES.md | 418 | Research findings |
| UNIFIED_GRAPH_REFINED_PLAN.md | 400 | Implementation plan |

**Total:** 2,148 lines of stable documentation

**Should move to repo if viz work continues.**

### Decision Points

**If testing viz build:**
- Open `/tmp/final-integrated/` and check FPS, mouse controls, crossfade
- If works → Commit all changes
- If partial → Cherry-pick good fixes only (42 lines)
- If broken → Revert, keep only performance fixes

**If returning to original task:**
- Commit documentation work (INDEX, THEORY_MAP, etc.)
- Archive viz work for later dedicated sprint
- Complete ChatGPT audit preparation

### Root Cause Found 🔥

**Original bug (in HEAD commit):**
```javascript
controls.mouseButtons = {
  LEFT: 0,   // ROTATE
  RIGHT: 0   // ROTATE (BOTH SAME!)
}
```

Both buttons were set to ROTATE. My fix: `LEFT: 2` (PAN, but selection.js intercepts for marquee).
