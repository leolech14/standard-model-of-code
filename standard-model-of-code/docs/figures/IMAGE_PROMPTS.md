# Image Generation Prompts ("Nanobanana Pro")

These prompts are optimized for high-fidelity, scientific-grade visualization.

## Figure 1: Unified Master Schema
**Prompt:**
> A highly technical, scientific-grade schematic diagram on a pure white background. The image features a central vertical spine numbered from L12 at the top to L-3 at the bottom, representing a 16-level hierarchy. To the left of the spine are architectural labels (Domain, System, Node) and to the right are code elements (Module, Class, Function). The style is strict, minimalist, black ink line art, similar to a patent illustration or architectural blueprint. No shading, high contrast, precise geometric lines. Mathematical symbols like sets and integrals are subtly visible.

## Figure 2: The Holonic Ascension (3D)
**Prompt:**
> A 3D isometric technical illustration of a digital tree structure on a white background. At the bottom (Z=0) is a flat grid plane of binary 1s and 0s. Rising from this are vertical lines connecting to a middle layer (Z=1) of linear logic nodes. These converge further up into a top layer (Z=2) which is a solid cubic volume representing a software module. The aesthetic is clean, black wireframe on white, architectural diagram style, visualizing the consolidation of data into structure. No colors, just black lines.

## Figure 3: Fractal Scale Invariance
**Prompt:**
> A strict geometric fractal diagram on a white background. A large square contains four smaller quadrants, and each quadrant is further subdivided into smaller squares, creating a recursive 'box-in-box' pattern. The lines are crisp and black. This represents software scope containment (System containing Modules containing Classes). The style is minimalist, technical drawing, high precision, no artistic flourishes, just pure geometry.
