## 3. SCHEMA

### Node (Minimal)

```json
{
  "id": "user.py:UserRepository",
  "name": "UserRepository",
  "kind": "class",
  "role": "Repository",
  "layer": "Infrastructure"
}
```

### Node (Full)

| Field | Type | Stage |
|-------|------|-------|
| `id` | string | 1 |
| `name` | string | 1 |
| `kind` | string | 1 |
| `file_path` | string | 1 |
| `start_line`, `end_line` | int | 1 |
| `complexity` | int | 1 |
| `role` | string | 2 |
| `role_confidence` | float | 2 |
| `layer` | string | 6 |
| `is_orphan` | bool | 7 |
| `is_hotspot` | bool | 8 |
| `body_source` | string | 1 |
| `in_degree` | int | 7 |
| `out_degree` | int | 7 |
| `topology_role` | string | 7 |
| `disconnection` | object | 7 |
| `betweenness_centrality` | float | 7 |
| `pagerank` | float | 7 |

### Relational Properties

Unlike intrinsic properties (atoms, roles, dimensions) which can be determined from a single node, **relational properties** emerge from graph context. You cannot know a node's `topology_role` without analyzing the entire dependency graph.

| Property | Requires | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `in_degree` | edge list | Number of incoming dependencies |
| `out_degree` | edge list | Number of outgoing dependencies |
| `topology_role` | full graph | Structural position in dependency graph |
| `disconnection` | full graph | Why orphan nodes appear disconnected (7 types) |
| `betweenness_centrality` | full graph | Bridge importance (0-1, higher = more paths through) |
| `pagerank` | full graph | Authority score (0-1, higher = more influential) |

#### Topology Roles

| Role | Condition | Meaning | Typical Atoms |
|------|-----------|---------|---------------|
| `orphan` | in=0, out=0 | Disconnected, possibly dead code | - |
| `root` | in=0, out>0 | Entry point, initiator | Main, Handler, CLI |
| `leaf` | in>0, out=0 | Terminal node, no dependencies | DTO, Query, Config |
| `hub` | high degree | Central coordinator, coupling risk | Service, Controller |
| `internal` | in>0, out>0 | Normal flow-through node | most nodes |

This classification follows graph theory conventions where "leaf" denotes a node with no outgoing edges (nothing depends on it downstream). The term was already used implicitly in `graph_type_inference.py` before being formalized here.

#### Disconnection Taxonomy (Jan 2026)

**Note:** The `orphan` label is a *misclassification bucket* conflating 7+ distinct phenomena. Only ~9% of orphans are truly dead code. For orphan nodes, a `disconnection` property provides rich classification:

| `reachability_source` | Meaning | Action |
|-----------------------|---------|--------|
| `test_entry` | Called by test framework (pytest, jest) | OK |
| `entry_point` | Program entry point (__main__, CLI) | OK |
| `framework_managed` | Instantiated by framework (dataclass, DI) | OK |
| `cross_language` | Called from different language (JS↔Python) | CHECK |
| `external_boundary` | Public API, exported function | CHECK |
| `dynamic_target` | Called via reflection/eval | CHECK |
| `unreachable` | True dead code, no callers | DELETE |

```json
{
  "topology_role": "orphan",
  "disconnection": {
    "reachability_source": "test_entry",
    "connection_gap": "isolated",
    "isolation_confidence": 0.95,
    "suggested_action": "OK - test framework invokes"
  }
}
```

#### Centrality Metrics

Network centrality measures a node's structural importance:

| Property | Algorithm | Meaning |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| `betweenness_centrality` | Shortest paths | Bridges between modules (change risk) |
| `pagerank` | Random walk | Influential nodes (authority) |

High centrality nodes are architectural hotspots requiring extra care when modifying.

### Edge (Minimal)

```json
{
  "source": "user.py:UserService",
  "target": "user.py:UserRepository",
  "edge_type": "CALLS"
}
```

### Edge Types

| Type | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| CONTAINS | Parent-child |
| CALLS | Function invocation |
| IMPORTS | Module dependency |
| INHERITS | Class inheritance |
| IMPLEMENTS | Interface realization |
| USES | General dependency |

## 4. PURPOSE FIELD

### Hierarchy

```
Level 4: PURPOSE FIELD     - Global gradient across codebase
Level 3: LAYER PURPOSE     - Shared purpose in architectural layer
Level 2: COMPOSITE PURPOSE - Aggregated from grouped components
Level 1: ATOMIC PURPOSE    - Intrinsic purpose of function/class
```

### Layer Flow

```
PRESENTATION    → Purpose: Display (user sees data)
      ↓
APPLICATION     → Purpose: Orchestrate (use cases happen)
      ↓
DOMAIN          → Purpose: Express (business rules enforced)
      ↓
INFRASTRUCTURE  → Purpose: Implement (technical details handled)
```

### Purpose Equations

```
π₁(node)  = role(node)
π₂(class) = emergence(Σ π₁(method))
π₃(layer) = common_purpose({π₂(component)})
Π(codebase) = ∫ π₃(layer) d(layer)
```

### Antimatter (Violations)

| Violation | Example |
|-----------|---------|
| Domain → Infrastructure | Entity imports PostgresAdapter |
| UI → Domain | Component calls repository directly |
| Test → Production | Test code in main bundle |

## 6. HISTORY

### The Discovery (Dec 2025)

**Hypothesis:** Code is ambiguous → need AI to classify

**Experiment:** 91 repositories, 270,000+ nodes

**Result:** 100% coverage with 0 unknowns — WITHOUT AI

**Discovery:** Information is encoded in:
1. **Topology** - `/services/UserService.py` reveals role
2. **Frameworks** - `@Controller` decorator reveals role
3. **Genealogy** - `extends Repository` reveals role

### The Pivot (Dec 23, 2025)

| Archived (AI-centric) | Promoted (Deterministic) |
|-----------------------|--------------------------|
| LearningEngine | HeuristicClassifier |
| AutoPatternDiscovery | UniversalDetector |
| LLMClassifier | PatternMatcher |

**Core Insight:**
> The deterministic layer IS the intelligence. The LLM layer is optional enrichment.

### Timeline

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| 2025-12-14 | Initial commit (Spectrometer v12) |
| 2025-12-23 | THE PIVOT: AI → Deterministic |
| 2026-01-11 | Rebrand: Spectrometer → Collider |
| 2026-01-19 | Atom integration (94 atoms unified) |

## 7. THEORETICAL LINEAGE

```
Koestler (Holons)     → 16 LEVELS + Systems of Systems
Popper (Three Worlds) → 3 PLANES
Ranganathan (Facets)  → 8 DIMENSIONS
Clean Architecture    → LAYER dimension
DDD (Evans)           → 33 ROLES
Shannon               → M-I-P-O CYCLE
```

### Holon Theory (Koestler 1967)

The 16-level scale is a **holarchy** - a hierarchy of holons. Each level is:
- A **WHOLE** when looking down (it contains parts)
- A **PART** when looking up (it is contained)

This is why **Systems of Systems** applies: every level is a system made of systems, recursively.

| Level | As WHOLE (looking down) | As PART (looking up) |
|-------|-------------------------|----------------------|
| L5 FILE | Contains classes, functions | Part of package |
| L3 NODE | Contains body, params | Part of file |
| L1 STATEMENT | Contains tokens | Part of block |

**Key insight:** Emergence happens at EVERY level transition. The purpose (π) of a higher level is emergent from, not merely aggregated from, its parts.

See `THEORY_EXPANSION_2026.md` Section 5 for full treatment.

## 8. THE 10 UNIVERSAL SUBSYSTEMS

Every codebase clusters into ~10 meta-components:

1. **Ingress** - Routers, controllers, middleware
2. **Egress** - External clients, webhooks
3. **Domain Core** - Entities, rules, use-cases
4. **Persistence** - ORM, repositories, migrations
5. **Async Processing** - Queues, workers, schedulers
6. **Presentation** - UI components, view models
7. **Security** - AuthN/AuthZ, policies
8. **Observability** - Logging, metrics, tracing
9. **Configuration** - Config loading, env vars
10. **Delivery** - CI/CD pipelines, IaC
