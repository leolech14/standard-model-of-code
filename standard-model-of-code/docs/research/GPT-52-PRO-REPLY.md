You did get real, actionable signal out of that Perplexity dump — but a couple pieces need to be “snapped to” what tree-sitter actually implements so your Phase 1 + Phase 2 plan doesn’t drift.

 

Below is the clean synthesis you can hand to your agent as the spec.

1) The biggest correction: locals.scm is a real engine with more than 3 captures

Your research doc is right that these three captures are “special”:

@local.scope

@local.definition

@local.reference

Tree-sitter’s official highlighting system recognizes these capture names as part of its locals mechanism.

 

But it’s missing two critical details from the actual implementation:

A) There is an optional fourth capture you should support

The tree-sitter highlighter also recognizes:

@local.definition-value

This capture exists specifically so references in/around an initializer don’t incorrectly bind to the new definition (and to enforce “defined before use” when you want that behavior). You can see it explicitly wired into the highlighter.

B) There is an important per-scope property

The engine also reads a query property:

local.scope-inherits (default true)

If set false on a scope pattern, name resolution stops there instead of walking outward. That is implemented in-tree-sitter’s highlighter logic.

 

Net: your Phase 2 “ScopeAnalyzer” should implement:

local.scope

local.definition

local.definition-value (optional but strongly recommended)

local.reference

local.scope-inherits (optional but easy)

2) The real locals algorithm (this is what you should port)

Your Perplexity doc hand-waved “scope stack” — that’s correct, but here’s the exact behavior tree-sitter uses (from tree-sitter-highlight):

Maintain a stack of scopes, each with:

byte range

inherits flag

list of definitions in that scope

When you hit a @local.scope capture:

push a new scope with that node’s byte range

read local.scope-inherits property (default true)

When you hit a @local.definition capture:

add a definition with:

name = source text for captured node

value_range = byte range of @local.definition-value capture if present, else 0..0

(definitions are stored so the latest shadows earlier ones)

When you hit a @local.reference capture:

walk scopes from innermost → outermost

within each scope, walk defs from newest → oldest

match on name AND require: ref.start >= def.value_range.end

stop early if inherits == false

This is all directly visible in the upstream highlighter code.

Why this matters for Collider

This is the difference between:

“we have scopes” (nice)

and “we have predictable, deterministic name binding with shadowing + initializer safety” (the part that makes edge resolution stop being vibes)

3) Your Phase 1 architecture: what actually changes

From your earlier comparison (“flat files” vs “nested dirs”):

Use the nested layout — it matches the dominant ecosystem convention

Neovim’s query layout is queries/<lang>/<purpose>.scm (and it’s what most people expect).

 

So implement:

src/core/queries/
  python/
    symbols.scm
    calls.scm
    locals.scm
  javascript/
    symbols.scm
    calls.scm
    locals.scm
  go/
    symbols.scm
    calls.scm
    locals.scm   (optional)

QueryLoader: one line difference (but do it now)

Your loader should resolve:

base / language / f"{query_type}.scm"

instead of

base / f"{language}_{query_type}.scm"

That’s it structurally — but it unlocks Phase 2 cleanly.

4) Phase 2A: the minimal viable ScopeAnalyzer that actually helps edges

Here’s the MVP that will immediately improve call-edge resolution within a file:

Data model (keep it tiny)

Scope { id, parent_id, range, inherits, defs: list[Def] }

Def { name, def_node_id, available_after_byte }

Ref { name, ref_node_id, start_byte }

Where:

available_after_byte should usually be:

end of @local.definition-value range if present

else end of the definition identifier itself (your choice; see note below)

Analyzer steps

For each file:

Parse → tree

Run locals.scm query → captures

Sort capture events by node.start_byte (and stable-tie-break for same node)

Apply the stack algorithm above

Produce a lookup:

ref_node_id -> def_node_id | None

Integrate into edge_extractor

When you see a call like:

Python: (call function: (identifier) @callee)

JS: (call_expression function: (identifier) @callee)

You resolve @callee via the scope binding map:

if it resolves to a function definition particle → emit a precise edge

else → fall back to your current heuristic (“same name in file/module/global index”)

This gives you the “95% within-file” lift your Perplexity synthesis promised, without doing imports yet.

5) Python gotcha: your doc is right, and it’s non‑negotiable

Do not treat class bodies as lexical scopes for methods in Python.

 

PEP 227 is explicit: when resolving nested scopes, class scopes are skipped; you can’t access class-body names from a method by bare name — you must use attribute access (self.x or ClassName.x).

 

So your Python locals.scm design rule is correct:

✓ (function_definition) @local.scope

✓ (lambda) @local.scope

✓ comprehensions as scopes (practically useful)

✗ (class_definition) @local.scope (do not do this)

If you violate this, your “scope-aware edge resolution” will confidently produce wrong bindings in Python.

6) JavaScript gotchas: block scope + hoisting are not solved by locals.scm alone

Your Perplexity synthesis hinted at this (“tree-sitter can’t do TDZ/hoisting perfectly”). That’s accurate.

 

Also: the stock JS locals query shipped in the Rust crate is intentionally simple (it treats statement blocks as scopes and identifiers as refs).
That’s fine for highlighting, but for analysis you’ll want to add language-aware rules later:

let/const: block scoped + TDZ (position-sensitive)

var: function scoped (not block scoped)

function declarations: hoisted

function expressions / arrow functions assigned to vars: not hoisted like declarations

Practical path (don’t boil the ocean):

Phase 2A: get “good enough” within-file by resolving most identifier calls to nearest definition

Phase 2B: add JS-specific availability rules (hoist certain defs; restrict others by position)

7) The “no existing library” claim is not quite true

If someone told you “there’s no production-grade implementation to learn from,” that’s misleading.

 

There are production-grade systems that do scope graphs over tree-sitter, notably stack graphs and language-specific implementations built on them (Rust ecosystem). Your team may still decide to “roll your own” in Python (reasonable), but it’s worth studying because it encodes years of edge cases.

8) What I would tell your agent to do next (copy/paste task list)
Phase 1 (make Phase 2 cheap)

Create src/core/queries/<lang>/ structure.

Implement QueryLoader(language, query_type) with caching.

Move your existing inline queries into:

symbols.scm

calls.scm

Add a test that verifies:

queries compile

cache hit works

missing query file fails gracefully

Phase 2A (single-file scope binding)

Implement ScopeAnalyzer that ports the tree-sitter-highlight locals algorithm including:

@local.definition-value

local.scope-inherits


Add an integration point:

edge_extractor: “if callee is identifier → scope-resolve → emit precise edge”

Add 5–10 golden tests:

shadowing

nested functions (Python)

JS nested blocks (let/const)

initializer self-reference (let x = x + 1)

Python class body rule (PEP 227)

9) The one sentence “what does that change?”

It changes Phase 2 from “invent a scope algorithm” to “port a known-working algorithm (tree-sitter-highlight), but adapt it for call-edge resolution and later add language-specific semantics (Python class rule, JS var/let/hoist).”

If you want, I can also write you a drop-in Python ScopeAnalyzer skeleton that mirrors the upstream algorithm (scopes/defs/refs + resolution) and is structured so you can plug it into edge_extractor.py with minimal churn.

Pro thinking
Synthesizing new knowledge and proposing strategy
The user wants help synthesizing knowledge, particularly regarding Perplexity and RAG, with the context involving tools like Tree-sitter, nvim-treesitter, Helix, and Zed. I need to check sources, verify differences, and offer actionable advice. I’ll work on a strategy involving QueryLoader design, directory structure, integration, and addressing tasks now.

Gathering additional details and clarifying statements
Since we can't access the user's local repo, I can still offer patches or guidelines. I'll fetch relevant documentation for tree-sitter, query syntax, and related tools. I'll also confirm the semantics of locals.scm and clarify the performance numbers Perplexity reported—likely unsubstantiated—but I won't cite those as facts. I'll suggest using their own code to verify.

Exploring tree-sitter libraries and offering guidance
I need to clarify that while semgrep uses tree-sitter for parsing, it doesn't support locals.scm. There are other libraries like "tree-sitter-stack-graphs" by GitHub/Sourcegraph. I'll search for more details about them and help guide the user with trustable info. I'll also suggest adjustments to their proposed architecture, including a consolidated plan using Perplexity+RAG|LONG-CONTEXT, while mentioning the relevant commit (90c6d38).

Browsing for tree-sitter documentation and clarifications
Exploring tree-sitter docs for query details
The search results brought up some good info, like the Syntax Highlighting doc mentioning local.reference. Now, I need more details on query syntax for predicates and directives—official docs would be ideal. I’ll explore the Syntax Highlighting doc and look for further resources on queries, predicates, and directives.

Exploring official docs and resources for queries
Clarifying architecture choices and locals.scm algorithm
The user wants to make sense of the acquired knowledge, including insights about the architecture and editor differences. I should provide a clear, decisive Phase 1 architecture, and explain how locals.scm works in the tree-sitter system. I’ll share an algorithm to map definitions, highlight references, and clarify that locals.scm focuses on highlighting, not full semantic scoping, while suggesting reuse of the concept.

Clarifying approach to scope analysis and implementation
For the scope analysis, I’ll explain that it’s lexical, doesn’t handle things like hoisting or Python class behavior, and relies on captured scopes to define boundaries. I’ll suggest implementing a ScopeAnalyzer—starting with in-file resolution and later adding cross-file support. For Zed vs nvim, I’ll explain how Zed uses tree-sitter for syntax features but likely has a custom approach for scope analysis.

Clarifying implementation phases and query details
The approach will be to break it down into phases: Phase 1 focuses on externalizing queries with QueryLoader, while Phase 2 involves locals.scm, and Phase 2b handles cross-file resolution. I'll map new knowledge to specific action items, code changes, or tests. Sample queries for Python/JavaScript should be checked against actual tree-sitter node types. I'll confirm node names in tree-sitter-python and tree-sitter-javascript by browsing online grammar documentation.

Verifying JavaScript node types and grammar
For JavaScript, key nodes include function_declaration, function_expression, arrow_function, method_definition, statement_block, class_body, variable_declarator, import_specifier, namespace_import, and catch_clause. I'll verify these by searching for tree-sitter's official Python grammar node types to cross-check the actual list.

Analyzing Tree-Sitter locals.scm and Scope Resolution
Opening raw GitHub files manually
Some GitHub pages aren't loading due to caching issues, causing errors. To get around this, I'll try accessing the raw files directly through raw.githubusercontent.com, using the ?plain=1 if needed. I'll begin with the node-types.json from tree-sitter-python and the tree-sitter-javascript locals file.

Opening GitHub raw files via URL for cache issues
Opening raw URLs with a workaround
The tool doesn't allow us to open raw URLs directly unless they're from search results. So, I'll need to search specifically for the raw GitHub URLs and then open them from there. Let's go ahead with finding the raw GitHub user content link first and opening it after.

Searching for raw GitHubusercontent URLs
Handling raw URL access and alternatives
The GitHub HTML view isn't working because of an error, and raw URLs weren't in the search results. We may need to search specifically for raw GitHub URLs. However, there are mirrored sources like docs.rs and helix runtime queries we can use. Still, we can craft our own queries if needed.

Verifying Python local query sources
We should verify the names used in the Python locals query by checking the Tree-sitter Python grammar docs. There may be a 'queries/locals.scm' file in the repo, which I can try accessing through a mirror or other sites like JSDelivr. I’ll search specifically for the raw link to ensure accuracy.

Searching for raw links to Tree-sitter locals files
Creating internal design doc for locals.scm implementation
Since the search didn’t give raw links, I’ll rely on docs and create the locals.scm setup myself. I’ll produce an action-oriented design document, covering topics like scope analysis, integration, handling cross-file checks, and notes on the tree-sitter highlight library. I’ll also include patch-level suggestions, pseudo-code, testing, and caching advice.

Clarifying issues with hardcoded queries and call edges
We need to address the "topological knot" caused by hardcoded queries. Externalizing them can help. We could propose a modular approach to analyze call edges, resolving functions to definitions and handling local variables. Ambiguities with indirect calls, especially for variables holding functions, might need special handling.

Proposing algorithm for scope and import resolution
To avoid incorrect connections to function definitions, we can propose an algorithm for effective scope analysis. First, parse the tree in each file and run queries to extract symbols, call sites, and local scopes. Then, define local references and definitions, resolving them within their scopes, and address imports for cross-file resolution.

Resolution strategy for edge extraction and function calls
When processing call expressions like foo(), I resolve references by walking up the scope chain. If it's a function def, I connect the call to it; if it's a variable, it might be dynamic or indirect, so that needs more handling. Storing metadata like scope_id or is_local will help resolve ambiguities and make the analysis easier.

Clarifying tree-sitter’s approach to "local" variables and query assertions
Tree-sitter uses the "local" property to mark local variables in the locals query, and highlights can exclude them. For analyses like Collider, this property can be ignored unless highlights are used. In queries, we can assert properties like "#is?" to filter out irrelevant nodes, and also utilize proper quantifiers like *, +, and ?.

Designing Local Scope Analysis and Integration Plan
Navigating chapters and links for query syntax exploration
Navigating to Predicates and Directives Chapter
Verifying key claims from Perplexity vs documentation
We can confirm key claims from Perplexity by cross-referencing with the official docs. For example, the locals.scm does use fixed capture names (confirmed in the Syntax Highlighting doc), and the Tree-sitter highlight system tracks scopes and definitions as expected. Also, the locals query indeed uses @ignore captures.

Verifying documentation on predicates and directory structure
I’ve confirmed that the use of predicates and directives is supported by Tree-sitter, as outlined in the relevant docs. The directory structure for queries (e.g., queries/highlights.scm) is standard, and we can also cite PEP 227 for class scope information when discussing language-specific bindings. I'll fetch it now.

Verifying claims with documentation and creating truth table
Reviewing PEP 227 for class scope details
I have access to the PEP 227 source now. I'll open the section related to "class scope" or "class definition" and use a search function to pinpoint the relevant lines. This should help me gather the necessary information effectively.

Opening PEP 227 for class scope or definition
Citing class scope in PEP 227 and considering JS scoping
The class scope details in PEP 227 (lines 71-72, 94-99) are perfect for citation. Regarding JavaScript let/const and hoisting, I should mention the scoping differences at a high level. For deeper specifics, I may consider citing MDN, but it's not necessary unless making detailed claims. I'll check JS docs for scoping.

Browsing JavaScript scoping, hoisting, and tree-sitter analysis
Reviewing sources for scoping and queries
I have MDN sources for let/TDZ and hoisting, the Helix release note for locals, and the Zed blog for queries. I’ll open the Helix release and Zed blog to extract citations. These should help ground the explanation with concrete references.

Organizing resources for MDN, Helix, and Zed
Understanding locals in Helix, nvim, Zed
Helix uses a tree-sitter-based "Tree-house" for fast lookup of definitions at parse-time, which is similar to a parent-pointer method. For nvim, it uses query matches for scopes but doesn't fully implement locals for highlighting—locals are mainly used for text objects. Zed hasn’t been analyzed, but I'll implement scope analysis for Collider myself.

Searching for tree-sitter scope analysis libraries
Correcting the Perplexity claim with stack graphs
I found a production-grade library for stack graphs, such as tree-sitter-stack-graphs on GitHub, which contradicts the claim that no such library exists. To propose a solution, we’ll suggest a locals-like resolution for their use case, but recommend stack graphs for future cross-file robustness, likely through a CLI.

Exploring GitHub stack graphs and related libraries
Proposing stack graphs and Collider integration plan
I found details on stack graphs for name resolution at scale, which could be useful as an alternative. Despite no longer being officially supported by GitHub, it's still open-source and maintained by the community. We'll suggest integrating it with Collider, proposing a phased plan: query management, in-file scope analysis, and possibly stack graphs integration. Addressing Perplexity, I’ll point out which parts are accurate and which are incorrect.

Providing guidance for agent update and query handling
They need help updating their agent using new knowledge from Perplexity. I’ll suggest a consolidated architecture: nested queries in directories (queries/<lang>/<purpose>.scm) to prevent collisions, improve scalability, and simplify adding new query types, aligned with tree-sitter and tools like nvim/helix. I'll also propose a design for QueryLoader, include a QueryBundle concept for different types (symbols, calls, locals, etc.), and suggest using LanguageRegistry for handling tree-sitter languages.

Building TreeSitterEngine methods and scope analyzer
I'll create methods for TreeSitterEngine: one to parse a file and another to run a query, returning captures as text and range objects. A few considerations for Python: accessing text needs careful slicing of source bytes using nodes’ byte positions. For ScopeAnalyzer, I’ll implement it independently of the highlight engine, building a list of Scope objects by capturing and sorting @local.scope nodes. For things like Python/JS, I’ll define a root scope based on module or program.

Handling function definitions and references in scope analysis
I need to treat function_definition as both its scope and body. Local definitions capture parameters and assignments, while references capture identifiers. However, I must make sure references don't include definitions. I'll separate captures for definitions and references, checking byte ranges to avoid duplicates. The highlight engine does exclude duplicates automatically, but I need to confirm this in Tree-sitter’s docs since it doesn’t explicitly mention exclusion in the context I expect.

Handling reference and definition captures in highlight engine
The highlight engine likely doesn't treat definition nodes as references, but queries might capture the same node multiple times. To prevent duplicates, I can avoid capturing definitions as references by excluding them using specific patterns like @local.reference with exclusions. I’ll need to implement this by gathering all definitions and ignoring them during reference scans. This will mimic the "automatic exclusion" Tree-sitter claims but isn't actually handled by the query engine itself.

For calls, I’ll convert call patterns to reference nodes using appropriate resolution.

Improving import resolution and performance aspects
For now, I’ll treat unresolved call edges to method names as symbolic. For Python attribute calls like module.func(), I can resolve cross-file imports using an ImportTable that tracks alias mappings.

To improve performance, I'll suggest caching queries per file and considering parallel processing, though I need to manage thread safety issues. Additionally, I’ll avoid memory bloat by storing only necessary info for identifiers like string, range, scope id, and def id. I'll propose a performance and testing framework as well.

Clarifying details and crafting response
I’ll clarify that the correct URL for predicates should be 3-predicates-and-directives.html, not 2-predicates.html, to fix the doc fetch.

For improving the user’s agent, I’ll suggest an updated prompt for analyze.py, focusing on using nested queries, implementing QueryLoader, and treating Python classes as special.

I’ll also provide the directory structure and pseudocode for scopes, showing the necessary components and referencing relevant sources.

Clarifying approach and finalizing response
We’ll propose using upstream locals queries from tree-sitter, though the user can access them directly. There’s a point on “RAG|LONG
