    "content": "Of course. As a senior software engineer, here is my analysis and recommended plan for SPRINT-002, focusing on repository consolidation and alignment. This plan is designed to be directly actionable by the agent team.\n\n### Executive Summary: SPRINT-002\n\n**Name:** Repository Alignment & Consolidation\n**Theme:** Pay down technical debt from initial project setup and establish a single source of truth for key artifacts. This sprint solidifies the foundation built in SPRINT-001, ensuring the repository structure is clean, logical, and ready for advanced automation by the BARE system.\n**Goal:** Eliminate structural duplication and ambiguity within the repository, making it easier and safer for agents to operate.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Prioritized Task List for SPRINT-002\n\nThis list promotes pending opportunities and known issues into actionable tasks.\n\n| Priority | ID | Title | Description | Source |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **1** | **TASK-004** | Consolidate All Research Directories | Migrate all research from `research/`, `tools/research/`, and `docs/research/` into a single canonical location: `docs/research/`. | `OPP-003` |\n| **2** | **TASK-005** | Unify Agent System Directories | Decommission the legacy `.agent/` directory within `context-management/`, ensuring only the root `.agent/` is used. | \"Known Repo Issues\" |\n| **3** | **TASK-006** | Sanitize Ephemeral Artifacts & .gitignore | Remove all transient `.collider_*` test directories and update `.gitignore` to prevent them from being committed in the future. | \"Known Repo Issues\" |\n| **4** | **TASK-007** | Document Agent Workflow Architecture | Create a canonical document explaining the full agent workflow: Inbox (OPP) -> Promotion -> Active Task (TASK) -> Sprint Execution. | `OPP-004` |\n\n---\n\n### 2. Dependency Graph\n\nThis sprint has a clear dependency flow. Structural changes must be completed before documentation is finalized.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    subgraph SPRINT-002\n        TASK-004[TASK-004: Consolidate Research]\n        TASK-005[TASK-005: Unify .agent Dirs]\n        TASK-006[TASK-006: Sanitize .gitignore]\n\n        subgraph \"Phase 1: Structural Changes\"\n            direction LR\n            TASK-004 --> TASK-007\n            TASK-005 --> TASK-007\n        end\n\n        subgraph \"Phase 2: Hygiene & Documentation\"\n            direction LR\n            TASK-006 --> TASK-007\n            TASK-007[TASK-007: Document Workflow]\n        end\n    end\n\n    style TASK-004 fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    style TASK-005 fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    style TASK-006 fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n    style TASK-007 fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n```\n**Execution Order:** `TASK-004`, `TASK-005`, and `TASK-006` can be worked on in parallel. `TASK-007` is blocked by the completion of all three.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Estimated 4D Confidence Scores\n\nConfidence scores are high as these are well-understood refactoring tasks.\n\n| Task | Factual | Alignment | Current | Onwards | **Overall** | Rationale |\n| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :--- |\n| **TASK-004** | 95% | 95% | 90% | 95% | **90%** | **Factual:** Locations are known. **Alignment:** Critical for the \"Research Refinery\" (`OPEN_CONCERNS.md`). **Onwards:** A prerequisite for the BARE Concept Mapper. |\n| **TASK-005** | 95% | 98% | 85% | 95% | **85%** | **Alignment:** Core to the \"Git is truth\" principle (`KERNEL.md`). **Current:** Risk of breaking hardcoded paths lowers this score slightly. |\n| **TASK-006** | 90% | 90% | 95% | 90% | **90%** | A straightforward cleanup task. High confidence in its execution and positive impact. |\n| **TASK-007** | 90% | 95% | 90% | 90% | **90%** | Documenting a just-completed system (`SPRINT-001`) is a high-confidence, high-value action. |\n\n---\n\n### 4. Risk Assessment\n\n| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation Strategy |\n| :--- | :---: | :---: | :--- |\n| **Broken Tooling** | High | Medium | Before committing file moves, perform a repository-wide `grep` for the old paths (e.g., `context-management/.agent/`, `tools/research/`). Update all identified scripts and configuration files in the same atomic commit. |\n| **Agent Work Collision** | High | Low | Announce a brief code freeze for this sprint. All work should be performed on a single branch and merged atomically. Use the `claim_task.sh` tool to prevent other agents from starting conflicting work. |\n| **Incomplete Consolidation** | Medium | Medium | Use `find . -type d -name \"research\"` and `find . -type d -name \".agent\"` to ensure all instances are identified before deletion. Verify with a `git status` check that shows only expected deletions and moves. |\n| **Data Loss During Moves** | High | Low | Strictly use `git mv` for all file relocations. This preserves history and makes changes verifiable. Before the final commit, run a `git diff --stat` to confirm that the number of file additions and deletions match and that no content was inadvertently dropped. |\n\n---\n\n### 5. Definition of Done (DoD) for Each Task\n\nThese criteria provide clear, verifiable completion states.\n\n#### **TASK-004: Consolidate Research Directories**\n- [ ] All content from `research/`, `tools/research/`, and `docs/research/perplexity/` is migrated to subdirectories under the single canonical path `docs/research/`.\n- [ ] The old directory structures are completely removed from the repository.\n- [ ] Any scripts or documentation referencing the old paths (e.g., `SUBSYSTEM_INTEGRATION.md`) are updated to point to `docs/research/`.\n- [ ] A commit is produced with the message \"refactor(repo): Consolidate all research artifacts into docs/research/\".\n\n#### **TASK-005: Unify Agent System Directories**\n- [ ] The directory `context-management/.agent/` is deleted.\n- [ ] All tools, schemas, and specs are confirmed to be operating from the root `.agent/` directory.\n- [ ] `manifest.yaml` and `KERNEL.md` are reviewed to ensure all paths are consistent with the root-level `.agent/` structure.\n- [ ] A commit is produced with the message \"refactor(repo): Unify agent system into root .agent/ directory\".\n\n#### **TASK-006: Sanitize Ephemeral Artifacts & .gitignore**\n- [ ] A search confirms no directories matching the pattern `.collider_*` exist in the repository.\n- [ ] The root `.gitignore` file contains entries for `.collider_*` and other known ephemeral patterns.\n- [ ] The BARE `TruthValidator` (`repo_truths.yaml`) has been re-run to reflect the cleaned file counts.\n- [ ] A commit is produced with the message \"chore(repo): Clean up ephemeral directories and update .gitignore\".\n\n#### **TASK-007: Document Agent Workflow Architecture**\n- [ ] A new file, `docs/architecture/AGENT_WORKFLOW.md`, is created.\n- [ ] The document clearly explains the lifecycle: `Opportunity (Inbox) -> Promotion -> Task (Active) -> Sprint`.\n- [ ] It references key tools like `promote_opportunity.py` and the `sprints/` directory.\n- [ ] A link to this new document is added to a relevant section in `.agent/KERNEL.md` (e.g., under \"Task / Run Separation\" or a new \"Workflow\" section).\n- [ ] A commit is produced with the message \"docs(agent): Document the full agent opportunity-to-sprint workflow\".",
