Multiple files confirm this, but here's the most direct evidence. `COMPLETION_REPORT.md` details:\n\n*   \"65 metadata files schema-validated\"\n*   States the CLI command `./pe refs show REF-001` can view metadata.\n*   Mentions metadata located in `gs://elements-archive-2026/references/metadata/`\n*   Lists a `metadata/` directory in the core library file structure.\n*   Specifies that 9 metadata files were fully analyzed.\n\nAlso, many other files such as `FINAL_CONFIDENCE_REPORT.md`, `FINAL_STATUS.md`, `INTEGRATION_COMPLETE.md` etc. refer to the existence and contents of the reference library metadata.\n\nIn conclusion, I can confirm that I have access to the files you listed, and I can also confirm that I have visibility into the reference library metadata based on the content of those files.\n",
