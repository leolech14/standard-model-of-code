    "content": "This is a clear architectural decision point, and the distinction between \"AI-powered semantic analysis\" and \"static structural checks/observability\" is key.\n\n**Decisive Answer:**\n\n*   `boundary_analyzer.py` **SHOULD remain in `context-management/tools/ai/`**.\n*   `gemini_status.py` **SHOULD be moved to `context-management/tools/maintenance/`**.\n\n---\n\n**Architectural Justification:**\n\n**1. Understanding the `tools/ai/` (ACI/AI Tools) Layer:**\nThis directory is the hub for **Adaptive Context Intelligence (ACI)** and other AI-related tools. Its core purpose is to facilitate **AI-driven semantic analysis, context curation, and validation**. Tools here either:\n*   Directly leverage AI models (`analyze.py`, `perplexity_research.py`).\n*   Implement the core logic of the ACI system itself (`aci/`).\n*   Perform semantic validation of architectural principles, often with AI augmentation or integration in mind (e.g., the Holographic-Socratic Layer - HSL).\n\n**2. Understanding the `tools/maintenance/` (Maintenance) Layer:**\nThis directory houses utilities for **repository state management, static structural checks, auditing, cleanup, and operational monitoring/reporting**. These tools generally perform their functions without direct AI reasoning, though their outputs might inform AI agents or human operators.\n\n**3. Analysis of `boundary_analyzer.py`:**\n*   **Purpose**: Validates `CODOME/CONTEXTOME` structure. The `CODOME` and `CONTEXTOME` represent fundamental partitions of the codebase, forming the semantic backbone of the `PROJECTOME`. Validating these structures is a high-level architectural integrity check.\n*   **AI Integration Potential**: The statement \"could use AI for smarter detection\" is crucial. This aligns `boundary_analyzer.py` with the **Holographic-Socratic Layer (HSL)**, which is explicitly implemented by `analyze.py --verify` (located in `tools/ai/`). HSL's role is to detect \"Architectural Drift\" (AM002) and other violations against `semantic_models.yaml`, which are essentially semantic boundary validations.\n*   **Conclusion**: Even if its current implementation might be a static check, its function of enforcing **semantic architectural boundaries** and its explicit potential for AI-driven enhancement firmly place it within the `tools/ai/` domain. It's not merely a \"static structural check\" in the sense of counting files or detecting stale code; it's about validating the *coherence of the semantic model* itself, a task deeply integrated with AI's understanding of the codebase.\n\n**4. Analysis of `gemini_status.py`:**\n*   **Purpose**: API usage observability. This tool monitors *how* the Gemini AI backend is being used (e.g., latency, cost, rate limits).\n*   **AI Usage**: The key here is \"monitors AI but doesn't USE AI\". This tool is a telemetry or infrastructure monitoring utility. It observes the AI system's performance and operational status, rather than contributing to the AI's intelligence, analysis, or semantic understanding of the codebase.\n*   **Conclusion**: Observability and monitoring of external services or system components are standard operational tasks. These tasks align perfectly with the responsibilities of the `tools/maintenance/` directory, which covers general system health, auditing, and operational support (e.g., `timestamps.py`, `archive_stale.py`). Placing it within `tools/ai/` would dilute the `ai/` directory's focus on AI-driven intelligence and analysis.\n\n---\n\nBy adhering to these distinctions, the project maintains a clear separation of concerns, making the architecture more intuitive for both human developers and AI agents.",
