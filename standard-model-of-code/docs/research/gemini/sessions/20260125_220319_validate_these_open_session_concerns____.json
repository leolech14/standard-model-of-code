Registry-Template Mismatch\n- Registry: 160 controls\n- Template: 176 elements  \n- Gap: 16 structural IDs flagged as unauthorized\n- Flagged IDs: 3d-graph, header, loader, toast, control-bar-container, filtering, selection, camera, accessibility, export, analysis, layout-phys, view-modes, panel-settings, node-appear, edge-appear\n- Question: Are these actually controls or structural containers? Should validator filter them?\n\n## 2. Handler Wiring Unknown\n- 57 new controls added to template.html\n- panel-handlers.js may not have handlers for all\n- Risk: orphaned controls (visible but non-functional)\n- Question: How to audit handler coverage?\n\n## 3. Pre-commit Hook Not Wired\n- validate_control_registry.py exists but not enforced\n- Can still add unregistered controls\n- Question: Is pre-commit enforcement the right pattern?\n\n## 4. Control Functionality Untested\n- 90 controls total, 0 manually tested\n- Question: What's the minimum viable QA approach?\n\n## 5. Plan vs Implementation Drift\n- Plan target: 82 controls\n- Implemented: 90 controls\n- Question: Close the plan or document the delta?\n\n## 6. Gatekeeper Pattern Validation\n- Created CONTROL_REGISTRY.yaml as single source of truth\n- Workflow: PROPOSED \u2192 AUTHORIZED \u2192 IMPLEMENTED\n- Question: Is this pattern sound? What's missing?\n\nRate each concern 1-10 for severity and provide recommended actions.\n"
