Domain (current choice)\n2. Sector\n3. Facet\n4. Vertical\n5. Concern (as in cross-cutting concern)\n6. Zone\n7. Sphere\n8. Province\n9. Aspect\n10. Slice\n\nFor each candidate, score:\n- Precision (does it mean what we want?)\n- Collision (conflicts with existing tech terms?)\n- Memorability (does it 'stick'?)\n- International (understandable to non-native English?)\n\nAlso: What would DDD practitioners think when they see 'Domain' in our context?"
