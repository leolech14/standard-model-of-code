These support queries over time intervals without overwriting historical data.[1][3][6]\n\n### Key Concepts from Temporal Databases\n- **Transaction Time**: Time interval during which a fact (e.g., file modification) is stored in the database; immutable and cannot extend beyond now. Used for auditing changes and identifying stale files (e.g., no updates since a cutoff).[1][3][8]\n- **Valid Time**: Time when the fact holds true (e.g., a file's content was active); allows \"what changed\" queries.[1][3]\n- **Types of Relations**:\n  | Type | Description | Use Case Fit |\n  |------|-------------|--------------|\n  | Uni-temporal (Transaction-time) | Tracks only storage times | File audit logs, staleness checks[3] |\n  | Bi-temporal | Tracks both valid and transaction times | Full event history with real-world validity[1][3] |\n  | Tri-temporal | Adds decision time | Less common for filesystems[1] |\n\nThis differs from related terms:\n- **Event Sourcing**: Stores event streams for state reconstruction, not inherently filesystem-focused.[4]\n- **Change Data Capture (CDC)**: Captures database row changes for replication, not file-level.[not in results]\n- **Audit Logging**: Basic event recording without built-in temporal querying.[not specialized in results]\n- **Activity Streams/Data Lineage**: Track user actions or data flow, not comprehensive filesystem timestamps.[not in results]\n\nTemporal databases address filesystem needs by natively supporting time-based queries (e.g., AS OF, BETWEEN timestamps) on historical versions, though they require more storage for versions.[1][2][3] Standard SQL:2011 includes basic temporal support, but full features often need extensions.[3]"
