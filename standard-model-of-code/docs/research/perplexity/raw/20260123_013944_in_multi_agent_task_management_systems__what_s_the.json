This avoids \"dirty\" commits but can block legitimate adaptations in dynamic multi-agent tasks involving state machines[4][7].\n\nConversely, **validation-only** (warning/normative mode) logs violations without blocking, supporting adaptive behavior and emergent collaboration in MAS[1][2], which is useful for parallel execution or human overrides. However, it risks accumulating invalid states in git history, complicating audits since history cannot be rewritten—potentially eroding trust signals over time[1].\n\n| Approach | Pros in Git Context | Cons in Git Context |\n|----------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| **Strict** | Clean, immutable history; enforceable compliance[1][6] | Reduced adaptability; workflow stalls[4] |\n| **Validation-only** | Flexibility for recovery; faster iteration[1][2] | Historical pollution; audit noise[1] |\n\nHybrid adaptive modes (escalating from warn to block based on history) balance this best for git, per trust-factor mechanisms[1]."
