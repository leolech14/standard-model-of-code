TruthValidator: Runs post-commit, checks if code matches established rules (backward-looking verification)\n2. Manual 'Socratic Research Loop': Human uses Gemini for internal analysis, Perplexity for external validation, to boost confidence before executing tasks\n\nProposed addition: boost_confidence.py that automates the Socratic Loop:\n- Takes task ID as input\n- Loads task description + relevant code context\n- Runs LLM assessment prompt\n- Optionally queries external search for validation\n- Outputs 4D confidence scores (Factual, Alignment, Current, Onwards)\n\nQuestions:\n1. Does separating 'verification' (post-commit) from 'validation' (pre-execution) make architectural sense?\n2. Is automating confidence scoring for AI agent tasks a valid pattern? Any risks?\n3. Should the confidence booster be allowed to auto-update scores, or should it only generate reports for human review?\n4. What's the standard practice for AI agent self-assessment before task execution?",

          "content": "**Yes, separating verification (post-commit) from validation (pre-execution) makes strong architectural sense.** This distinction aligns with modular AI system design, where pre-execution validation acts as a proactive guardrail to assess task feasibility and risks before commitment, while post-commit verification ensures compliance after changes are applied[1][2][3][4]. Pre-execution steps enable problem decomposition, simulation, and confidence checks to prevent issues like hallucinations or misalignments, whereas post-commit focuses on auditability and rollback[3].\n\n**Automating confidence scoring for AI agent tasks is a valid and increasingly common pattern, but it carries risks like over-reliance on LLM self-assessment.** It supports self-awareness loops, continuous monitoring, and evaluation stages in AI pipelines, as seen in GenAI reliability principles that use LLMs for real-time performance assessment[3]. Risks include hallucinated scores, lack of ground truth, or insufficient external validation, which can propagate errors in agentic workflows; mitigation involves layered guardrails, diverse input simulation, and human oversight[1][3].\n\n**The confidence booster should primarily generate reports for human review rather than auto-updating scores.** This preserves auditability, allows cross-validation (e.g., via external search or Socratic loops), and aligns with best practices for policy-based controls, signed artifacts, and iterative human-in-the-loop refinement in AI/ML pipelines[1][2][4]. Auto-updates risk unverified changes in high-stakes codebases; reserve them for low-confidence thresholds with explicit safeguards.\n\n**Standard practice for AI agent self-assessment before task execution emphasizes structured evaluation loops with guardrails, monitoring, and human oversight, rather than fully autonomous decisions.** Common patterns include:\n- **Problem decomposition and planning**: Break tasks into subtasks with LLM-driven assessment[3].\n- **Guardrails and simulation**: Runtime checks for factual accuracy, alignment, and relevance via layered safeguards and test simulations[3].\n- **Evaluation and monitoring**: Score outputs (e.g., on quality metrics) with continuous LLM-based self-reporting, often integrated into CI/CD pipelines[1][2][3].\n- **Governance integration**: Use modular architectures with pre-execution validation, feature stores, and real-time analytics before deployment[4].\nThese appear in enterprise AI frameworks on Kubernetes and GenAI systems, prioritizing observability and rollback over blind execution[1][4]. For codebases, extend to context-aware prompts with external validation, mirroring your proposed 4D scores."
