Evaluations draw from linguistic roots and software contexts like executable specifications, where documentation and code must align verifiably.[1][2][3][4]\n\n| Candidate     | Etymology                          | Precision for Meaning                                                                 | International Clarity                  | Technical Collisions                                                                 |\n|---------------|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **1. Correspondence** | Latin *correspondere* (respond together, match)[general knowledge] | High for pairing/matching, but lacks inherent measurability (too vague for \"health metric\"). | High (common, intuitive globally).    | Low; general term, no major software conflicts.                                      |\n| **2. Coherence**    | Latin *cohaerere* (stick together)[general knowledge] | Medium; implies logical consistency, but not specifically paired or measurable.       | High (widely understood).              | Medium; used in physics (coherent waves) and software (code coherence).              |\n| **3. Pairing**      | Old English *gepara* (make two equal)[general knowledge] | Low; denotes simple coupling, ignores correspondence/alignment metric.                | High (straightforward).                | Low; Bluetooth pairing, but not alignment-focused.                                   |\n| **4. Binding**      | Old English *bindan* (tie together)[general knowledge] | Medium; suggests tight linkage (e.g., data binding), but not semantic/metric-based.   | Medium (may confuse with legal ties). | High; programming (variable binding, UI data-binding).                               |\n| **5. Alignment**    | Old French *aligner* (line up)[general knowledge] | High for matching, fits \"health metric\" (e.g., alignment scores), but misses explicit pairing. | High (visual metaphor clear).         | Medium; machine learning (sequence alignment), DevOps (alignment practices).         |\n| **6. Bundle**       | Middle English *bundel* (collection)[general knowledge] | Low; implies packaging, not correspondence or measurement.                            | High (everyday term).                  | Medium; software bundling (e.g., npm bundles).                                       |\n| **7. Accord**       | Old French *acorder* (agree)[general knowledge] | Medium; suggests harmony, but informal and non-technical for metrics.                 | Medium (musical/legal connotations).   | Low; rare in tech.                                                                   |\n| **8. Nexus**        | Latin *nectere* (connect)[general knowledge] | Low; means central link, but abstract, no measurability.                              | Low (uncommon, formal).                | Medium; legal/tech (nexus of control in software architecture).                      |\n| **9. Coupling**     | Latin *copula* (link)[general knowledge] | Medium; common for code connections (loose coupling), but implies dependency over alignment. | Medium (technical tone).              | High; software engineering (coupling metrics like cohesion).[general knowledge]     |\n| **10. Concordance** | Latin *concordare* (agree together)[general knowledge] | **Highest**: Precise for paired textual/code agreement with quantitative measure (e.g., concordance coefficients in NLP for semantic alignment).[3] | Medium-high (cognates in Romance languages; clear in academic/tech use). | Low; NLP/stats (concordance lines/correlation), no direct code-doc collision—enhances fit for \"health metric.\"[1][3] |\n\n**Concordance** stands out for software contexts like executable specifications, where specs map to code steps with verifiable behavioral alignment—mirroring a measurable \"health\" between documentation and execution.[1][2][3] It avoids collisions with formats like ELF (Executable and Linkable Format).[5]"
