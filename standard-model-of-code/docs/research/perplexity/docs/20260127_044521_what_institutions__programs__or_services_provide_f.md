# Free Digital Access to Academic Papers and Books for Independent Researchers: A Comprehensive Overview of 2026 Options

The landscape of free academic access has transformed dramatically, with multiple legitimate pathways now available for independent researchers seeking scholarly materials without university affiliation. As of January 2026, the combination of open access mandates, expanding repository networks, publisher initiatives, and institutional programs creates unprecedented opportunities for accessing paywalled academic literature through legal and ethical means. This report synthesizes current information about the principal systems and programs offering free access to academic papers and books, including recent policy changes, eligibility requirements, access limits, and practical strategies for maximizing research capabilities without institutional affiliation.

## Personal Account-Based Access Programs

### JSTOR's Free Register and Read Initiative

JSTOR's personal account system represents one of the most accessible entry points for independent researchers seeking structured access to scholarly content[1]. The service allows anyone with an email address to create a free account that provides access to limited collections of read-only content. Within this free tier, registered users can read up to one hundred articles every thirty days online, a significant allowance that permits substantial research engagement throughout extended projects[1]. The account creation process is straightforward, requiring only an email address, and the system sends verification emails that expire after fifteen minutes, though clicking expired links automatically generates new verification messages[1].

Once registered, users maintain persistent access to their personal workspace where they can save, organize, and manage citations for research projects, articles, and papers directly within the JSTOR interface[1]. This citation management feature proves particularly valuable for researchers coordinating multiple sources across disciplines. The platform distinguishes between different user types, and personal accounts specifically provide access to the "Open JSTOR Collection," which comprises curated open-access materials, early journal content in the public domain, and shared collections[4]. Additionally, JSTOR's institutional partnerships sometimes allow individual users affiliated with public libraries or museums that have licensed remote access to utilize those institutional subscriptions for broader content access[4].

However, several limitations constrain the utility of JSTOR's free tier for comprehensive research projects. The one-hundred-article monthly limit means that researchers conducting literature reviews requiring dozens or hundreds of sources will exhaust their quota within weeks[1]. Downloaded and printed articles may be retained and reused in accordance with JSTOR's terms and conditions, but only the limited quantity permitted monthly can be initially accessed[4]. For books specifically, JSTOR's free offering remains severely restricted compared to articles. The platform does provide perpetual access arrangements for institutional subscribers whose institutions cancel subscriptions, but independent researchers lack this protection[4]. Researchers with specific institutional connections—such as alumni status at schools offering alumni access or affiliation with qualifying societies—may gain enhanced access, but these represent exceptions rather than standard provisions for unaffiliated individuals[4].

## Internet Archive and the Open Library System

### Current Status Following Hachette v. Internet Archive

The Internet Archive represents perhaps the most ambitious free access initiative in existence, having maintained the Wayback Machine preserving twenty-eight years of web history and having worked with over twelve hundred library and institutional partners[2]. However, the September 2024 U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruling in *Hachette v. Internet Archive* significantly curtailed the organization's direct lending program. The court determined that scanning copyright-protected books to deliver free digital copies online constitutes copyright infringement rather than permissible fair use, finding that the reproduction and distribution were not transformative and usurped the commercial market belonging to copyright holders[2].

Despite this legal setback, the Internet Archive announced in December 2024 that it would not appeal the decision to the Supreme Court, prioritizing organizational stability while continuing to honor agreements with the Association of American Publishers regarding removal of books at member publishers' requests[5]. This decision effectively ended the expansive lending program that had previously offered millions of digitized books for free borrowing. The precedent established by the Second Circuit creates substantial legal jeopardy for similar initiatives, as the court weighted all four factors of the fair use test against the Internet Archive despite acknowledging the program's noncommercial nature and the organization's nonprofit status[2].

Nevertheless, the Internet Archive maintains significant free access to materials through alternative mechanisms. The Wayback Machine continues providing access to historical websites and documents archived since 1996, functioning as an essential resource for historical research and documentation preservation[2][19]. The organization's partnership model with libraries and cultural institutions ensures continued preservation efforts, and researchers can still access public-domain works, government documents, and other non-copyright-protected materials. The Open Library component, which operates through a lending model rather than permanent download, may continue functioning for certain materials, though the recent legal climate creates uncertainty about the sustainability of such initiatives[41].

### Project Gutenberg and Public Domain Collections

Project Gutenberg provides access to over seventy-five thousand free ebooks, primarily focusing on classic literature and historical texts where U.S. copyright has expired[30]. The service requires no registration or fees, offering perpetual access to public domain materials in multiple formats including EPUB and Kindle-compatible files[30]. Thousands of volunteers have digitized and proofread these materials, ensuring quality standards for research purposes. For historians, classicists, and researchers investigating historical scientific thought, Project Gutenberg represents an invaluable resource capturing foundational texts and primary sources[19][30].

However, Project Gutenberg's utility for current academic research is inherently limited by its focus on historical materials. Contemporary books and recent publications remain largely outside its scope, and researchers requiring up-to-date scholarly monographs or recent editions of reference works will find Project Gutenberg insufficient as a sole resource. The platform's alphabetical browsing structure and basic search functionality also require more effort than modern database interfaces, though dedicated researchers willing to invest time can locate relevant historical materials successfully[30][33].

## Research4Life and International Development Programs

### HINARI Program Eligibility and Access

Research4Life represents a consortium of public-private partnerships designed specifically to improve access to scientific research in developing countries[3][6]. The initiative encompassing HINARI (focused on health research), AGORA (agriculture), OARE (environment), ARDI (development innovation), and GOALI (legal information) provides either free or subsidized access to quality scientific journals for institutions in eligible countries[6]. HINARI specifically provides access to health and biomedical research and has operated since 2002 as a founding member initiative alongside Springer Nature[6].

Eligibility for HINARI and related programs operates through institutional registration rather than individual enrollment[3]. Individuals cannot directly register for HINARI access; instead, permanent and visiting faculty, scientists, students, medical specialists, and staff members of registered institutions are entitled to obtain institutional credentials to access the platform[3]. Registration occurs at the institutional level through local, not-for-profit institutions, allowing eligible organizations to access research at tiered pricing structures. Over one hundred countries, areas, and territories currently qualify for participation based on four factors: total Gross National Income, GNI per capita according to World Bank figures, status on the United Nations Least Developed Country list, and Human Development Index rankings[3].

The program's tiered structure creates two access categories: Group A countries with GNI per capita below $1,250 receive completely free access, while Group B countries with GNI per capita between $1,250 and $3,500 pay an annual fee of fifteen hundred dollars per institution per year, which grants access to all four programs simultaneously with certain publisher exclusions by country[3]. Institutions in Band 2 countries receive a three-month free trial period before payment obligation begins[3]. Importantly, access to HINARI remains restricted to in-country usage, meaning users must physically or digitally connect from within eligible countries to utilize the service[3]. This geographic restriction significantly limits utility for independent researchers in developed nations seeking tropical medicine or development-focused research, though it perfectly serves researchers in targeted developing regions.

### OARE Program for Environmental Research

The Online Access to Research in the Environment program operates on similar geographic principles to HINARI, providing environmental science journals and related content for free or at minimal cost to developing country institutions[48]. Seventy countries whose GNP per capita falls below one thousand dollars receive completely free access, creating substantial equity in environmental research access[51]. OARE covers broader environmental and related science topics compared to HINARI's health specialization, making it valuable for ecology, environmental management, and sustainable development research[48][51].

Like HINARI, OARE functions through institutional registration rather than individual accounts, with all members—employees, faculty, researchers, teachers, administrators, staff, and students—of registered institutions and their visitors eligible to access materials[48]. Outside-institution access availability depends on registration status, and researchers must verify whether their institutions qualify and have completed registration procedures[48]. Even for researchers in countries not meeting full eligibility criteria, OARE provides free access to journal abstracts from all indexed publications, permitting literature discovery even without full-text retrieval[48].

## Government-Funded and Mandate-Driven Open Access Systems

### NIH Public Access Policy and PubMed Central

The National Institutes of Health's 2024 Public Access Policy represents a watershed moment in open access mandates, fundamentally transforming access to federally-funded biomedical research[7][10]. Effective July 1, 2025, the policy requires all Author Accepted Manuscripts resulting from NIH funding and accepted for publication in any journal to be submitted to PubMed Central immediately upon acceptance for publication, with public availability guaranteed from the Official Date of Publication without embargo periods[7][10]. This immediate, embargo-free requirement dramatically expands free access to cutting-edge biomedical research compared to previous policies that permitted twelve-month embargo periods.

PubMed Central operates as a free full-text archive maintained by the U.S. National Institutes of Health's National Library of Medicine, currently housing 11.7 million articles across 3,017 full participation journals, 249 NIH portfolio journals, and 45 selective deposit programs[58]. The expansion driven by the new 2024 NIH policy means that virtually all NIH-funded research published after July 1, 2025, will appear in PMC free of charge, creating rapidly expanding access to health sciences literature. For independent researchers working on health, medical, biological, and related topics, PubMed Central and PubMed's links to free versions constitute an invaluable resource for peer-reviewed, high-quality research[13][58].

However, the NIH policy's benefits apply only to research explicitly funded by NIH, which, while substantial, does not encompass all biomedical research. Research funded by other government agencies, private foundations, or conducted without external funding remains subject to traditional journal publication restrictions unless the authors independently choose open access or the journals operate on open access models. Additionally, the policy's implementation period means that research published before July 1, 2025, may still carry embargo restrictions depending on publication agreements, requiring verification of availability status on a per-article basis[7][55].

### Plan S and Transformative Journal Agreements

Plan S, an open access initiative beginning in 2018, requires research funded by specific funding agencies and institutions to be published in open repositories or in journals providing free access to manuscripts[54]. This initiative has prompted major publishers to create transformative journal agreements with institutional consortia, whereby participating institutions commit to financial agreements allowing their affiliated researchers to publish open access at no additional cost[53]. At institutions with such agreements—such as participating Big Ten universities with Springer agreements—affiliated researchers receive zero-cost, uncapped open access publishing across Springer's hybrid journals[53].

For independent researchers without institutional affiliation, Plan S primarily offers indirect benefits through expanded open access repositories and compliance requirements that generate more freely available research. However, some funding agencies that support independent or international researchers have implemented Plan S-compliant requirements, meaning grantees must ensure immediate open access to their publications. The knowledge that Plan S requirements will increasingly drive open access creation provides assurance that research landscape will continue opening, even if current independent researcher access remains limited compared to institutional researchers[54].

## Open Access Journal Ecosystems and Collections

### Directory of Open Access Journals

The Directory of Open Access Journals represents the most comprehensive and vetted collection of legitimate open access journals, currently indexing twelve thousand open access journals containing over three million full-text articles[20][25]. DOAJ functions as a community-driven discovery service verifying that indexed journals meet rigorous publishing standards and transparency criteria, serving as a quality assurance mechanism that distinguishes legitimate open access journals from predatory publishers[20][25]. All DOAJ services remain free of charge, and all data is freely available for researchers and institutions[20].

Access through DOAJ operates through direct journal browsing or search by subject area, allowing researchers to identify relevant open access publications in their fields[20][25]. Unlike paywalled journals where access requires institutional subscription or individual purchase, all DOAJ-indexed journals provide immediate, unrestricted access to their full contents upon publication[20]. This makes DOAJ invaluable for independent researchers, as discovering the appropriate open access journal in one's field essentially solves the access problem entirely. For researchers spanning multiple disciplines—particularly mathematics, physics, philosophy, computer science, biology, and systems theory—DOAJ contains numerous high-quality peer-reviewed journals covering each area[20].

Researchers should note that while DOAJ's existence guarantees accessibility of indexed journals' contents, not all research topics will be comprehensively covered by open access journals. Established closed-access journals in particular fields continue dominating publication venues for certain specialized research. However, the quantity and quality of open access journal coverage continues expanding, and increasingly, premier researchers choose open access venues to maximize research impact and accessibility[20][25].

### Springer Nature and Elsevier Open Access Collections

Springer Nature and Elsevier have both substantially expanded open access offerings through multiple mechanisms. Springer publishes over one hundred eighty-three thousand open access articles across disciplines through its "gold open access" model, representing forty-four percent of all Springer Nature articles in 2023[56]. Authors publishing in Springer's open access journals pay article publication charges funded through institutional agreements, research funding, or author resources, but readers access all published articles free of charge[56]. Researchers can discover these articles through Springer's platforms and filter specifically for open access content[56].

Elsevier operates similarly, offering numerous fully open access journals where articles undergo rigorous peer review and appear immediately and permanently free for everyone to read and download with permitted reuse through Creative Commons licenses[11][49]. Elsevier also provides emergency access to relevant research during health crises and maintains repositories of open access content[52]. Additionally, Elsevier has negotiated open access agreements with numerous institutions globally, meaning increasing proportions of their content become freely available through various mechanisms[49].

For independent researchers, these publisher initiatives mean that discovering articles through Google Scholar or CORE and identifying Springer or Elsevier open access content provides substantial free access to high-quality peer-reviewed research across disciplines. The key limitation remains that researchers must still identify individual articles as open access, rather than accessing comprehensive article collections at once[11][49].

## Preprint Servers and Repository Networks

### ArXiv and Discipline-Specific Preprint Repositories

The arXiv e-Print Archive, operated by Cornell University Library and curated by volunteer moderators, offers open access to over one million preprints across eight subject areas: physics, mathematics, computer science, quantitative biology, quantitative finance, statistics, electrical engineering with systems science, and economics[13][18]. For researchers in mathematics and physics particularly, arXiv provides comprehensive access to preprints and published papers, with most papers on the site being free access despite occasional paywalls[13]. The advisory committees for each subject area ensure quality curation, and the archive emphasizes openness, collaboration, and scholarship[13].

A network of specialized preprint servers now covers additional disciplines. BioRxiv provides free distribution of unpublished preprints in life sciences[15]. MedRxiv serves medical, clinical, and health sciences research[15]. PsyArXiv covers psychological sciences[15]. SocArXiv hosts social science preprints[15]. TechRxiv covers electrical engineering, computer science, and related technology[15]. These repositories allow researchers to access preliminary research findings, working papers, and papers under review or recently accepted, providing earlier access to emerging research than waiting for formal journal publication[15][18].

Importantly, preprint versions frequently contain complete methodology and findings equivalent to published journal articles, making preprint access particularly valuable for active researchers tracking emerging work in their fields. Many researchers maintain personal pages on preprint servers with curated collections of their work, effectively creating personal academic repositories[15][18]. However, researchers should understand the distinction between preprints and peer-reviewed published articles, as preprints have undergone community review by volunteer moderators and field experts but not formal journal peer review[18].

### CORE and Global Repository Networks

CORE aggregates the world's largest collection of open access research papers, currently providing access to over two hundred nineteen million records with approximately five million articles stored directly on CORE itself[14][17][45]. CORE's mission centers on making open access research available universally by aggregating content from diverse systems including repositories, open access journals, and other sources, then enriching this content using text mining and data mining techniques[14][17]. The platform provides both comprehensive search interfaces and machine-accessible APIs for bulk data access, serving researchers, institutions, companies, and funders[17].

CORE's value for independent researchers lies in its comprehensive aggregation spanning thousands of different systems and sources. Rather than searching each repository individually, researchers can search CORE's unified interface to discover relevant open access papers across all participating repositories and journals globally[14][17]. The platform provides monthly support to approximately twenty million active users worldwide, indicating substantial adoption and utility[17]. CORE also actively promotes open access through partnerships with repositories, libraries, and institutions, essentially functioning as infrastructure supporting the broader open access ecosystem[14].

## Academic Search Engines and Discovery Tools

### Google Scholar and Semantic Scholar

Google Scholar provides a free search engine specifically designed for academic content, indexing journal articles, theses, books, preprints, conference papers, abstracts, and technical reports across all disciplines[42]. While many results link to paywalled content, Google Scholar frequently identifies free full-text versions hosted on open access repositories, publisher websites, university repositories, or author personal pages[42]. The search engine ranks results by relevance, considering citation counts, author reputation, and journal quality, making it easier for researchers to identify the most trusted sources[42].

Google Scholar's particular value derives from its breadth—providing a single search interface for heterogeneous content types across all disciplines—and its integration of citation tracking features[42]. Researchers can explore which articles have cited a source, which related articles exist, and set up email alerts for new articles matching search queries[42]. For independent researchers without access to institutional library discovery systems, Google Scholar essentially replaces librarian-mediated subject searching, though less sophisticated than specialized databases[26][42].

Semantic Scholar, an AI-powered research tool, now indexes over two hundred thirty-two million papers from all fields of science[38][35]. The platform uses advanced AI and machine learning to understand scientific literature's semantics, facilitating discovery of highly relevant research beyond simple keyword matching[38]. Researchers can search by topic and receive filtered results by publication type, date range, and other parameters[35]. Semantic Scholar's AI-powered capabilities mean that related article suggestions and citation tracking provide more intelligent research connections than basic search engines[35][38].

### Unpaywall and Legality-Focused Discovery

Unpaywall represents a critical tool for independent researchers, functioning as a browser extension and online database that legally identifies and provides access to full-text scholarly articles available through legitimate channels[24][27]. The service harvests open access content from over fifty thousand publishers and repositories, aggregating metadata on twenty million free scholarly articles[27]. When researchers encounter paywalled articles through traditional search engines or journal websites, Unpaywall can identify whether free legitimate copies exist elsewhere and provide direct access links[24].

The distinction between Unpaywall and illegitimate alternatives like Sci-Hub lies in Unpaywall's commitment to legal access pathways. Unpaywall locates articles deposited in institutional repositories, publisher open access collections, author personal pages, preprint servers, and other legitimate venues where authors or publishers have intentionally made content freely available[24][27]. This approach respects copyright while simultaneously expanding researcher access to the vast quantity of research authors wish to share freely. For each article encountered, Unpaywall can indicate whether free access exists through metadata indicators showing whether full text is available under open access arrangements[27].

## Institutional and Library Partnership Programs

### University and Public Library Digital Access

Many universities provide free digital access to substantial research collections from their public library systems or through community access programs. The Los Angeles County Library system, serving millions of residents, provides free digital access to books, music, courses, and extensive research databases through Libby by OverDrive, Hoopla, and numerous specialized databases covering history, literature, science, and other domains[36][39]. Students with LA County Library cards can access unlimited online resources, practice tests, and tutoring services through platforms like Brainfuse and LearningExpress[39].

Public library systems nationwide increasingly offer similar digital access programs. Researchers should investigate whether their local library system provides digital access to academic databases, ebook collections, and research tools. Many library systems permit free digital membership through online registration without requiring in-person visits, meaning researchers living anywhere can access their local library's digital collections[36][39]. This represents an often-overlooked free access avenue available to independent researchers simply through permanent local residence[36].

The Library of Congress provides extensive online access to American cultural heritage including digitized collections, photographs, manuscripts, newspapers, and other historical materials available through loc.gov[12]. Recent additions include seventy-five thousand volunteer transcriptions from the Early Copyright Records Collection, foreign legal gazettes, recordings from the PALABRA Archive featuring authors reading their works, and specialized collections including rare manuscripts[12]. The British Library similarly provides online access through EThOS (E-Theses Online Service) with over five hundred thousand doctoral theses from British institutions, with more than half providing immediate download access[13].

Europeana aggregates Europe's digital cultural heritage from thousands of institutions, enabling researchers to search and access art, books, films, and music from across the continent[19]. These institutional programs collectively represent vast troves of historical materials, primary sources, and cultural artifacts freely available for research purposes without requiring university affiliation[12][19].

## Open Access Monographs and Book Collections

### Directory of Open Access Books

The Directory of Open Access Books functions similarly to DOAJ but focusing specifically on peer-reviewed scholarly books published open access[43][46]. DOAB indexes open access books from vetted publishers meeting rigorous quality standards, helping researchers distinguish legitimate open access publishers from predatory operations[43]. All DOAB services remain free, and all indexed data is freely available, supporting the organization's mission that all scholarly books should be shared openly for collective human benefit[43].

DOAB's index encompasses books across numerous disciplines and subjects, with over three million publications now discoverable through the directory[43]. Researchers can search by subject, publisher, language, and other criteria to locate relevant open access books in their fields[43]. Given that researchers typically require books covering foundational topics, history, theory, and comprehensive treatments within their subjects, DOAB's free open access book collections address critical scholarly needs beyond journal articles[43][46].

### World Bank Open Knowledge Repository

The World Bank's Open Knowledge Repository houses thirty-nine thousand seven hundred sixty-seven publications spanning decades of development research and analysis[37][40]. While focused on development and global economic topics, the repository's breadth encompasses research on economics, labor markets, health, education, climate, and numerous related areas[37][40]. The repository operates on open access principles, providing free access to research reports, policy briefs, journal articles, books, and datasets generated through World Bank research initiatives[37][40].

For researchers investigating development economics, climate finance, labor markets, public health in developing countries, and related topics, the World Bank repository provides authoritative, peer-reviewed research completely free of charge[37][40]. The repository's inclusion of detailed methodology, implementation frameworks, and evidence-based recommendations makes it valuable for applied research and policy analysis, not merely theoretical inquiry[37][40]. Researchers should note that while the World Bank repository focuses on development topics, its comprehensive treatment of global economic phenomena and research partnerships spanning multiple institutions means relevant materials may exist for diverse research questions[37][40].

## Discipline-Specific Collections and Specialized Repositories

### Philosophy and Social Sciences

PhilArchive provides free access to items in the Philosophy E-Print Archive without requiring user accounts[31]. The non-profit project supported by the PhilPapers Foundation aggregates philosophical papers and preprints, facilitating rapid dissemination of new work within the philosophical community[31]. For philosophers and researchers investigating philosophical questions across metaphysics, epistemology, value theory, science logic, mathematics, history of philosophy, and other areas, PhilArchive provides comprehensive open access to philosophical scholarship[31][34].

SocArXiv offers a free, non-profit, open access platform for social scientists to upload working papers, preprints, and published papers with options to link data and code[15]. For sociology, political science, economics, and other social science disciplines, SocArXiv enables researchers to discover and access emerging scholarship freely[15]. The platform's ease of use and author control over content encourage many social scientists to deposit their work, creating rapidly growing collections of social science research freely available to all[15].

### Grey Literature and Technical Reports

OpenGrey indexes over five hundred thousand bibliographic references of grey literature—reports, working papers, technical documents, and other non-traditional publications—produced across Europe[29][32]. Covering pure and applied science, technology, economics, and humanities, OpenGrey provides access to substantial quantities of research that may not appear in traditional journal publication venues but remains vital for comprehensive literature reviews and evidence synthesis[29][32]. For researchers synthesizing evidence across multiple publication types, OpenGrey access to grey literature prevents research gaps that might result from limiting searches to peer-reviewed journals alone[29][32].

## Limitations and Considerations

Despite expansive free access options now available, substantial limitations persist for independent researchers. First, while open access coverage continues growing, many established journals in particular specialties remain closed-access with no corresponding open access duplicates. Researchers investigating cutting-edge developments in highly specialized fields may still encounter paywalls at critical papers. Second, older or historical research published before open access movements accelerated remains largely behind paywalls, particularly for books and monographs published through traditional academic presses before digital distribution became standard.

Third, discovery remains non-trivial. While Google Scholar, Semantic Scholar, and CORE provide powerful search capabilities, finding relevant materials still requires substantial researcher effort and search strategy sophistication. Researchers familiar with librarian-led research strategies may find independent searching less efficient than institutional library support. Fourth, access availability fluctuates as institutional arrangements change, funding supports evolve, and legal precedents shift. The Hachette v Internet Archive ruling illustrates how legal changes can suddenly curtail access previously assumed reliable.

Fifth, metadata quality and searchability vary substantially across repositories and sources. Some preprint servers and institutional repositories maintain minimal documentation, complicating material identification and assessment. Sixth, individual article or book discovery typically works better than comprehensively accessing all materials on particular topics, as most free repositories require active searching rather than browsing entire collections. Seventh, international access restrictions apply to some programs like HINARI and OARE based on geographic location and national development status.

## Conclusion

The 2026 landscape of free academic access represents a fundamentally expanded ecosystem compared to even five years prior. Independent researchers no longer face absolute paywalls preventing access to scholarly literature; rather, they encounter optimization challenges—identifying which materials are freely available and deploying efficient strategies to access them. The combination of JSTOR personal accounts, Internet Archive collections, preprint servers, open access journals, search engines like Google Scholar and Semantic Scholar, discovery tools like Unpaywall and CORE, institutional partnerships, government mandates like NIH's expanded open access policy, and publisher initiatives collectively ensures that substantial proportions of contemporary research remain freely accessible.

For researchers requiring eighty-three references spanning mathematics, physics, philosophy, computer science, cognitive science, biology, systems theory, sociology, and design theory across publication dates from 1736 to 2024, a strategic approach combining multiple resources will likely identify free access to the majority of needed materials. Early foundational works are often available through Project Gutenberg or institutional archives. Contemporary research published after 2018 increasingly appears in open access journals or repositories due to open access movement growth and policy mandates. Mathematics and physics papers predominantly exist on arXiv with free access. Philosophical and social science papers appear on PhilArchive and SocArXiv. Biology research funded by NIH appears in PubMed Central. Books increasingly appear through DOAB and Internet Archive collections.

Researchers should prioritize systematic approaches: first searching discipline-specific repositories appropriate to content areas, second identifying authors' institutional repositories where deposited versions may exist, third checking CORE and Google Scholar for any freely available copies, fourth consulting Unpaywall for legitimate access paths, fifth examining whether journal content appears through open access publisher initiatives, and only then considering institutional access through library systems or paid access for remaining materials. This systematic approach maximizes free access before requiring alternative solutions, ensuring research proceeds efficiently while respecting intellectual property rights and utilizing legitimate open access infrastructure that increasingly embodies the academic community's commitment to accessible scholarship.
