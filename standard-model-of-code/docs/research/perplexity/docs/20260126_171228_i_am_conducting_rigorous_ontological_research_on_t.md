# The Ontological Status of Tools: A Comprehensive Analysis Across Philosophy, Cognitive Science, and Formal Ontology

This comprehensive report examines the ontological nature of tools across multiple disciplinary perspectives, establishing that tools constitute a category of entities whose being is fundamentally relational, processual, and dependent upon situated human (and non-human) agency. Rather than possessing a fixed essence independent of use contexts, tools exhibit what might be termed **contextualized affordance structures**—they become ontologically determinate only through the interactive coupling of material substrate, designed functional capacity, and embedded practices. The philosophical investigation reveals that tools occupy a liminal ontological status between present-at-hand (object-like) and ready-to-hand (practice-embedded) modes of being; cognitive science demonstrates that tool engagement represents a fundamental extension of human cognition itself; formal ontology provides systematic frameworks for categorizing tools within hierarchies of artifacts and dependent continuants; and the distinction between software and physical tools reveals deep differences in how immaterial vs. material substrates enable or constrain functional realization. Throughout, the analysis emphasizes that any adequate ontology of tools must integrate phenomenological insights concerning embodied experience, formal categorical distinctions from contemporary ontology, and empirical findings from cognitive neuroscience regarding the neuroplastic incorporation of tools into extended body representations.

## Philosophical Ontology of Tools: Heidegger's Fundamental Distinction

The contemporary philosophical investigation of tools begins with Martin Heidegger's distinction between two fundamental modes of being: present-at-hand (Vorhandenheit) and ready-to-hand (Zuhandenheit), concepts that have become foundational across multiple domains of inquiry including human-computer interaction design, phenomenological psychology, and artifact theory[1]. According to Heidegger's analysis, the ontological status of an entity is not fixed or essential but rather emerges through the relational context in which the entity appears to consciousness. A tool, in its authentic mode of being, is ready-to-hand—it exists as a functionally integrated element within a meaningful network of purposes and practices. This ready-to-hand mode characterizes the tool when it "fits into a meaningful network of purposes and functions" and becomes "part of a world of practice," such that the tool, in a phenomenologically precise sense, "disappears" from conscious attention during skilled use[1]. When one employs a mouse in computer interaction, for instance, the mouse ceases to be an object of which one is aware; rather, it becomes an extension through which one acts, a transparent mediator between intention and world. The mouse achieves this transparency only insofar as it has been incorporated into one's practical mastery—one's embodied skills and habituated capacities to engage with computational systems.

Crucially, Heidegger's analysis resists the temptation to treat ready-to-hand being as merely a subjective or psychological phenomenon. Rather, as Paul Dourish's interpretation emphasizes, the ready-to-hand status reflects a genuine ontological transformation wherein "the mouse is, in Heidegger's terms, ready-to-hand, i.e. it fits ('seamlessly') into a meaningful network of actions, purposes and functions. In being part of one's action, it becomes part of 'oneself', 'one's body', part of a domain of 'ownness' or 'mineness'"[1]. This incorporation represents not a metaphorical extension but a constitutive modification of one's bodily being-in-the-world. The tool becomes, in a profound sense, part of the self that acts through it; the boundaries between subject and tool dissolve within the flow of practiced engagement.

The transition to present-at-hand being occurs precisely when this transparency is disrupted. When a tool malfunctions or fails to operate as expected, it ceases to be ready-to-hand and instead becomes present-at-hand—it becomes an object of explicit attention, a "thing" to be examined, analyzed, and understood through theoretical contemplation[1]. When one's mouse breaks or becomes unresponsive, suddenly one's attention is drawn to it as an object; one examines its physical properties, considers what might be wrong, treats it as something to be investigated and potentially repaired. This shift from ready-to-hand to present-at-hand represents a fundamental ontological change, not merely a change in one's psychological attitude toward the tool. As Dourish explains, "The mouse becomes problematic, as one acts to solve or resolve the problem. When one acts on the mouse in this way, being mindful of it as an object of my activity, as an object or a theoretical (problem-solving) gaze, the mouse is present-at-hand"[1].

Yet Dourish's interpretation, following Heidegger, advances a thesis of still greater philosophical radicality: the ontological status of an entity is not simply revealed through these different modes of consciousness; rather, the entity's existence as a determinate being is constituted through such moments of disclosure. Dourish states that "Heidegger argues that the mouse exists as a mouse only because of the way in which it can become present-at-hand. The origin of ontology, and the existence of entities, lies precisely in the way those moments make objects apparent"[1]. This constitutive thesis dissolves the traditional philosophical assumption that objects possess a fixed nature independent of how they appear to consciousness. Instead, the tool's being—what it fundamentally is—emerges only through the dynamic interplay between ready-to-hand engagement (where it becomes transparent and incorporated) and present-at-hand reflection (where it becomes visible as a distinct entity). The tool does not simply exist "out there" waiting to be discovered; its existence and identity are generated through its role in human practice and its capacity to become the focus of explicit attention. This insight has profound implications for how we understand artifacts more generally, suggesting that their ontological status is inescapably relational and contextual rather than intrinsic and unchanging.

### Phenomenological Embodiment and the Tool-Body Integration

The phenomenological tradition, particularly through the work of Maurice Merleau-Ponty and his development of Husserl's phenomenological method, has extended Heidegger's analysis by investigating the precise mechanisms through which tools become incorporated into the body schema—the lived, pre-reflective sense of one's bodily capacities and boundaries[2]. Merleau-Ponty's phenomenological reduction, in contradistinction to Husserl's classical version, does not bracket the world in order to examine consciousness in isolation; rather, it suspends the "natural attitude," our unreflective assumption that the world exists independently of our experience, in order to make manifest "the inescapable entanglement of subject and world"[2]. This phenomenological method reveals that the tool-body integration is not a secondary or derivative phenomenon but rather constitutive of how consciousness relates to reality itself.

The incorporation of tools into the body schema operates through what contemporary neuroscience terms **neuroplasticity**—the brain's capacity to reorganize its functional organization in response to systematic patterns of tool use. When we consistently use a tool, the neurological representation of the body's boundary expands to include the tool itself. Research demonstrates that "the areas activated during the identification of the tools considerably overlap with premotor areas activated during another experiment where subjects were asked to imagine right hand movements," suggesting that tool identification involves the reactivation of sensorimotor circuits originally developed through direct bodily manipulation[42]. This neural incorporation reflects a fundamental principle of embodied cognition: understanding proceeds through the activation and simulation of sensorimotor states, not through the manipulation of abstract symbols detached from bodily experience[26][42].

The phenomenological significance of this neurophysiological finding is profound. When one learns to use a tool skillfully—whether a hammer, a tennis racket, or a musical instrument—one literally reshapes one's neural representation of bodily boundaries. The tool becomes incorporated into what Merleau-Ponty called the **body schema**, the pre-reflective, implicit sense of where one's body ends and where the world begins. This body schema is not a fixed anatomical boundary but rather a dynamically organized field of potential action. As one's tool use becomes more skilled and habituated, the incorporation becomes deeper; the tool's interface gradually disappears from conscious attention, and one acts through it with the same immediacy with which one acts through one's hands or eyes. Yet this incorporation is neither automatic nor inevitable; it requires sustained practice, proper design of the tool's interface, and appropriate feedback structures that allow the sensorimotor system to generate accurate predictions about the consequences of tool-mediated action[29].

The phenomenological approach further reveals that tool use transforms not merely one's sense of bodily boundaries but one's entire intentional structure—the way in which consciousness is directed toward and engaged with the world. Polanyi's concept of **tacit knowledge**, which emphasizes "the unstated, instinctive, and internalized know-how that individuals possess" and the principle that "we know more than we can tell," captures the epistemological dimension of this embodied tool engagement[7]. When one operates a tool skillfully, one's knowledge of how the tool functions, how it responds to subtle variations in pressure or angle, how it must be positioned to achieve particular effects—all this knowledge remains largely implicit, embedded in bodily capacities rather than represented in explicit, linguistic form. This tacit dimension is not a limitation of knowledge but rather reflects a genuine mode of understanding that cannot be fully articulated because it is fundamentally embodied and situated[7][10].

## Heidegger's Object-Oriented Reconsideration: Tool-Being and Withdrawal

Graham Harman's development of object-oriented ontology, grounded in a reinterpretation of Heidegger's tool analysis, provides a further philosophical complication of the ready-to-hand distinction. Harman argues that Heidegger's discussion of tools reveals something deeper than the conventional distinction between subjective attitudes toward objects: it points toward a fundamental metaphysical principle concerning the nature of all entities, not merely human artifacts[4][32]. According to Harman's reading, Heideggerian **Zuhandenheit** (readiness-to-hand) "refers to the withdrawal of objects from human perception into a reality that cannot be manifested by practical or theoretical action"[4]. This interpretation radically revises the standard phenomenological reading of Heidegger. Rather than ready-to-hand being a mode in which the tool is present but unnoticed, Harman suggests that ready-to-hand being actually characterizes a fundamental withdrawal of the object from full presence—a dimension of the tool's reality that can never be exhaustively captured either through practical use or through theoretical investigation.

This metaphysical thesis of **object withdrawal** proposes that every entity, including tools, possesses a reality in excess of its relations, uses, and appearances[4][32]. A hammer cannot be reduced to the sum of its functional capacities, its material composition, its historical uses, or its place within systems of practice. Rather, the hammer retains an essential obscurity, a core of being that remains hidden from both the user who employs it and the theorist who examines it. As Harman maintains, "if the human perception of a house or a tree is forever haunted by some hidden surplus in the things that never become present, the same is true of the sheer causal interaction between rocks or raindrops"[4]. This principle of withdrawal applies not only to human-tool relations but to all relations between entities. The tool's mode of being includes dimensions that are fundamentally inaccessible to any relation, whether practical or theoretical, human or nonhuman. The ready-to-hand status of a tool thus reflects not the tool's transparency to use but rather the way in which practical engagement with the tool masks its deeper, withdrawn reality—the aspects of the tool's being that transcend any particular functional role.

Harman's framework introduces a formal structure for understanding tool ontology through the concept of **tensions** between different types of objects and qualities. According to his analysis, tools are characterized especially by the tension between **Real Objects and Sensual Qualities** (RO-SQ)—a withdrawn object presents itself through sensible qualities that are accessible to experience or action[4]. The handle of a hammer provides a "surface" through which the tool's withdrawn reality is accessed; the weight, texture, and shape of the handle constitute the sensual qualities through which one engages the hammer, yet these sensible characteristics can never exhaust what the hammer is in itself. This formal distinction allows for a more precise characterization of tool being than the simple binary of ready-to-hand versus present-at-hand. Tools, in this framework, are fundamentally defined by the gap between their accessible, relational properties and their withdrawn, intrinsic reality.

### Intentionality and the Directedness of Tool-Use

The philosophical analysis of tools connects intimately with the theory of **intentionality**—the fundamental characteristic of mental states whereby they are "about" or directed toward things in the world. As Brentano's foundational formulation establishes, mental phenomena are distinguished from physical phenomena precisely by their intentional inexistence, their directedness toward objects that may or may not exist[11][56]. When one uses a tool, one's mental states—one's intentions, perceptions, understanding of the tool's function—are directed not merely toward the tool itself but toward the goals that the tool enables one to achieve. One does not typically intend the hammer itself; rather, one intends to drive the nail, and the hammer appears as a mediator within this intentional structure. The tool becomes, as Heidegger suggested, phenomenologically transparent precisely because the intentional focus passes through it toward a further goal.

However, the relationship between intentionality and tool use becomes more complex when we recognize that tools themselves are fundamentally constituted by intentionality. As defined in contemporary philosophy of mind, an artifact such as a tool is characterized by what Hilpinen terms the **Dependence Condition**: "The existence and some of the properties of an artifact depend on an author's intention to make an object of certain kind"[52]. This intentional dependence means that a tool is not simply an object toward which intentionality is directed; rather, the tool itself exists as a tool only because it embodies prior intentionality—the designer's intention to create an implement capable of performing specific functions[48][49][52]. Thus tools exhibit a distinctive ontological structure: they are dependent on intentionality both for their existence (as artifacts, they exist because someone intended to create them) and for their function (they work only when integrated into someone's intentional project).

This double intentional dependence distinguishes tools from natural objects, which exist independently of any intention, yet also raises questions about whether tools can be understood through the standard phenomenological framework. If tools are fundamentally dependent on human intention for their existence, how can they ever fully withdraw into a present-at-hand mode in which they appear as self-subsistent entities? And conversely, if the ready-to-hand mode of a tool involves the transparency of the tool within an intentional structure directed toward further goals, must we not recognize that even in their most engaged, practical use, tools remain marked by an intentional structure that cannot be fully absorbed into embodied action? These questions point toward the recognition that tools constitute a unique ontological category precisely because they exemplify a peculiar entanglement of material being, functional capacity, and intentional constitution.

## Cognitive Science and the Extended Mind: Tools as Cognitive Integration Points

The analysis of tools becomes enriched substantially when we integrate insights from cognitive science, particularly the theory of **extended cognition** developed by Andy Clark and David Chalmers, which proposes that "the mind does not exclusively reside in the brain or even the body, but extends into the physical world"[3]. The extended mind thesis fundamentally challenges the traditional assumption that cognition is an internal, brain-based process that merely uses external tools as inputs and outputs. Instead, it proposes that certain external objects can become constitutive parts of cognitive processes themselves[3][6]. Clark and Chalmers illustrate this principle through their thought experiment involving Otto and Inga, two individuals traveling to a museum. Otto has Alzheimer's disease and relies on a notebook in which he has written all his directions, while Inga relies on her internal biological memory to recall directions. The crucial insight is that "the only difference existing in these two cases is that Inga's memory is being internally processed by the brain, while Otto's memory is being served by the notebook"[3]. Otto's notebook qualifies as an extension of his mind because it is "constantly and immediately accessible" to him and is "automatically endorsed" by him—it plays the same functional role as internal memory processes would[3].

For Otto's notebook to function as a genuine cognitive extension rather than merely an external aid, it must satisfy the criterion of **active externalism**: the external object must actively contribute to the cognitive process in the here-and-now, not merely serve as a repository for information that the brain must retrieve and process internally[3][6]. Clark emphasizes that "the external features here are just as causally relevant as typical internal features of the brain," meaning that the notebook's inscriptions directly shape Otto's behavior and decision-making without requiring intermediate internal processing[6]. This principle has radical implications for understanding tools. A well-designed tool does not merely extend the brain's capacity to manipulate external objects; rather, the tool becomes integrated into the cognitive architecture itself, such that cognition literally extends into and through the tool's material structure.

The extended mind thesis requires a reconceptualization of what we mean by "using a tool." Traditional accounts treat tool use as a relation in which an agent employs an external object as a means to achieve predetermined goals. But the extended cognition framework suggests that this picture is fundamentally backward. Rather, tools help to **constitute the cognitive goals and capacities themselves**. As Clark notes, "thinking itself may be fundamentally dependent on the availability of external resources," and these resources are not merely passive repositories but active shapers of cognitive processes[3][6]. The calculator that one uses to solve a mathematical problem is not simply a tool that implements algorithms one could perform mentally with greater difficulty; rather, the possibility of engaging in certain forms of mathematical reasoning is constitutively dependent on access to the calculator. The cognitive process literally extends through the calculator's material operations; without it, one does not merely perform the same operations more slowly, but rather engages in a fundamentally different cognitive process.

This integration of tools into cognitive architecture has profound implications for understanding skilled tool use. When a craftsperson achieves mastery with a particular tool—say, a woodworking plane or a musical instrument—they have not merely learned to operate an external implement efficiently; rather, they have incorporated the tool into an extended cognitive system that generates novel possibilities for action and perception. The tool user, in their extended cognitive state, perceives affordances in materials and situations that would be inaccessible to an agent lacking the requisite tool and training[3]. A carpenter with mastery of specific planes perceives wood grain patterns and surface irregularities as objects for the planes to address; this perception is not purely subjective but is constituted through the actual capacities that the tools afford. The tool does not mediate a perception that would exist independently; rather, the tool actively shapes what becomes perceivable and actionable.

### Tacit Knowledge and the Transparency of Tool Integration

Michael Polanyi's concept of **tacit knowledge**, central to understanding how tools become integrated into skilled practice, complements the extended mind thesis by accounting for the epistemological dimensions of tool embodiment. Polanyi's foundational insight—"we know more than we can tell"—captures the recognition that much of our knowledge, particularly that involved in skilled tool use, remains implicit and difficult to articulate[7][10]. When one has mastered a tool through extended practice, one's knowledge of how to use it becomes largely tacit; one can perform elaborate operations with the tool while remaining unable to specify verbally all the principles and techniques involved. A violinist can adjust bow pressure, angle, and velocity with extraordinary precision to produce subtle variations in tone, yet cannot fully articulate the rules governing these adjustments; the knowledge is embedded in embodied capacities that have been developed through sustained practice[7].

Polanyi illustrates this principle through the example of the "blind man's probe": a person using a cane to navigate while blind gradually learns to direct their attention not to the cane itself but through the cane to the terrain. The cane serves as an extension of tactile sensation; after sufficient practice, one is not aware of the cane in the hand but rather aware of the ground through the cane[10]. This example reveals that tool transparency is not a given but rather an achievement that requires proper tool design and sufficient practice. The tool must be such that it can fade from conscious attention, and this requires that it provides immediate, unambiguous feedback, that it is appropriately scaled to human biomechanical capacities, and that repeated use can establish reliable sensorimotor patterns. The probe becomes transparent not because one ceases to see the cane but because one's intentional focus passes through the cane to its functional target.

The connection between tacit knowledge and tool transparency reveals something crucial about how tools function cognitively. As Polanyi explains, "Wherever connoisseurship is found operating within science or technology we may assume that it persists only because it has not been possible to replace it with a measurable grading"[10]. This statement suggests that certain aspects of tool mastery—the ability to judge the quality of one's work, to perceive subtle deviations from desired specifications, to make intuitive decisions about how to proceed—remain tacit because they cannot be fully codified into explicit rules. Tool use at the level of craftsmanship necessarily involves tacit dimensions; even if one could articulate some principles, the full richness of skilled performance transcends any possible explicit specification. This recognition has significant implications for understanding how tools can be taught and transmitted. As Polanyi notes, practical knowledge "cannot be transmitted by prescription" (meaning written or spoken instruction); rather, it must be acquired through sustained engagement, typically through apprenticeship, wherein the learner gradually internalizes embodied patterns of practice[10].

## Formal Ontology and the Categorical Status of Tools as Artifacts

The philosophical investigation of tools connects with contemporary formal ontology through the systematic analysis of **artifacts** as a distinctive ontological category. Formal ontologies such as the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) and the Descriptive Ontology for Linguistic and Cognitive Engineering (DOLCE) provide explicit categorical structures for representing how artifacts, including tools, differ fundamentally from natural objects[9][13]. These ontologies distinguish between **continuants** (entities that endure through time maintaining identity, with no temporal parts) and **occurrents** (events and processes that occur in time)[9][13]. Tools are classified as continuants, but a specific variety: they are **dependent continuants** that cannot exist without their material substrate, yet whose functional and intentional characteristics cannot be reduced to their material composition alone.

More specifically, within BFO's hierarchical structure, tools are classified as **artifacts** (a subclass of material entities), but artifacts represent a peculiar ontological status. Unlike natural kinds such as biological species, which are defined by intrinsic physical properties and evolutionary history, artifact kinds are partially constituted by external, intentional features. As Risto Hilpinen's foundational analysis establishes, an artifact must satisfy three conditions: it must be intentionally produced (thus excluding unintended byproducts); it must involve modification of materials (thus excluding natural objects used as tools); and it must be produced for a purpose (thus excluding objects that are intentionally modified but serve no further goal)[48][52]. These conditions encode the recognition that artifacts, unlike natural objects, derive their essential characteristics partly from human intention.

BFO further distinguishes between **dispositions** (realizable entities or powers that depend on an object's material composition) and **roles** (realizable entities that depend on external conditions or social recognition)[12]. A hammer's disposition to break windows depends on the hammer's material make-up—its hardness, mass, and structural integrity; if these material properties were to change, the disposition would cease to exist[12]. In contrast, a hammer's role as "a classroom tool for demonstrating physics principles" depends not on its intrinsic material properties but on the external social and institutional context; change the context, and the role disappears while the hammer's material properties remain unchanged. This distinction reveals that tools operate through multiple ontological layers: they have intrinsic physical capacities (dispositions) that remain constant across contexts, yet their functional identity and significance shift depending on the roles they are assigned within different practices and institutions[12].

The relation between artifacts and their material substrate is analyzed within formal ontology through the concept of **constitution** or **dependence**. According to the Constitution Relation formalized in BFO frameworks, an artifact is constituted by but not identical to its material base. The clay that constitutes a clay statue has different persistence conditions than the statue itself; the statue ceases to exist if it is destroyed or melted down, yet the clay continues to exist. Similarly, a wooden hammer is constituted by wood, but the hammer is not identical to any particular collection of wood atoms. The artifact's identity is partly constituted by its form (the shape and arrangement of material) and partly by its functional role (what it is designed and used to accomplish). This constitutional relationship reflects the intuition that artifacts are inherently **hylomorphic** entities—they are constituted by matter (hyle) informed by form or design (morphe)[48].

### Mereological Structure and Artifact Composition

The ontological status of tools becomes further clarified through **mereology**, the formal theory of parthood relations. Within mereological frameworks, we can analyze how tools are composed of parts, how these parts relate to the whole, and how the identity of the tool depends on its mereological structure[25][28]. A hammer, for instance, has a head (typically metal) and a handle (typically wood or composite material) as its principal parts. Yet the mereological relation between these parts is not arbitrary; the hammer's identity depends on a specific configuration wherein the head and handle are appropriately joined and proportioned relative to each other. Simply placing a metal object against a wooden stick does not constitute a hammer; the parts must be properly integrated, which typically requires that they be fastened together with sufficient strength to transmit forces effectively.

Formal ontology recognizes that not all parthood relations are equally significant for artifact identity. Some properties and components are essential to what makes something the kind of artifact it is, while others are accidental. For a hammer, the presence of a head capable of striking and a handle capable of being gripped are essential; the specific wood species, the exact weight, or the finish color might be accidental properties that can vary while the object remains a hammer[20][23]. This distinction between essential and accidental properties operates differently for artifacts than for natural kinds. The essential properties of a hammer are partly defined by what functions the artifact is designed and used to perform, not merely by invariant physical properties. A hammer might function to drive nails, to pry open boards, or to demonstrate mechanical principles in a classroom; its essential nature is constituted through these functional specifications, which are themselves human-dependent[45][48][49].

The mereological complexity of tools reveals itself particularly in considering how tools are manufactured and how their parts relate to their function. Engineering ontologies distinguish between **functional decomposition** (dividing a tool into parts based on the distinct functional roles each part plays) and **physical decomposition** (dividing the tool based on material composition and spatial arrangement)[37][40]. A hammer can be functionally decomposed into "the part that strikes" and "the part that is grasped," yet these functional parts do not correspond to obvious physical boundaries; the head is the striking part, but the top of the handle also participates in the striking function by transmitting force. This gap between functional and physical decomposition reveals that tools are fundamentally structures organized to achieve specific purposes, and this purposive organization cannot be read directly off the tool's material structure.

## Tool Interface, Function, and the Distinction Between Implementation and Specification

Understanding tools at the level of formal ontology requires distinguishing between a tool's **interface** (the boundary through which users interact with the tool and perceive its functional capacity) and its **implementation** (the internal mechanisms and material structure through which the tool achieves its functions). This distinction, familiar in software engineering where the interface is often sharply separated from the implementation, applies more generally to all tools[27][30]. A hammer's interface consists of the handle (which a user grips), the striking surface (which contacts the target), and potentially other user-perceptible features. The hammer's implementation includes the internal crystal structure of the metal head, the grain structure of the handle wood, the specific design of the joint, and countless other material details that the user never perceives directly.

The interface-implementation distinction proves ontologically significant because a tool's identity from the user's perspective depends primarily on its interface—what functions it makes available, how it responds to user actions, what feedback it provides. The implementation details matter only insofar as they enable the interface to function reliably. This principle reveals why tools can be materially diverse yet functionally equivalent. Two hammers made from entirely different materials, by entirely different manufacturing processes, might present nearly identical interfaces and thus function equivalently from the user's perspective. What makes them both hammers is not their shared material composition but their shared interface structure and functional capacities.

In formal ontology, a tool's **specification** encompasses both the interface and the functional requirements that the implementation must satisfy, without necessarily specifying how those requirements are to be achieved[27][30]. The specification defines what the tool must do; the implementation reveals how it accomplishes this. This distinction proves crucial when analyzing tools in different domains. A musical instrument like a violin has a highly specified interface (the strings, fingerboard, and bow must be arranged in particular ways) and specific functional requirements (it must produce tones of particular pitch and quality), yet violins with quite different internal structures and materials can satisfy this specification and thus be recognized as genuine violins by musicians[40].

## Cognitive Integration and the Extended Body Schema

Recent neuroscientific research on tool embodiment has refined our understanding of how tools become integrated into the body schema—the neural representation of bodily boundaries and capacities. The **rubber hand illusion** (RHI) and related paradigms reveal that tools can be incorporated into the body image (the consciously perceived body) under specific conditions: when a tool's morphological and sensorimotor properties match the user's input and output capacities[29]. Research demonstrates that "proprioceptive drift in the RHI occurred when the tool's output and the user's input matched, but not when this match was absent," suggesting that tool embodiment requires a functional congruence between the tool's design and the user's sensorimotor capacities[29].

This finding reveals a fundamental principle: tools do not automatically become embodied simply through use; rather, embodiment requires that the tool's interface be designed to provide appropriate feedback, that the morphological fit between user and tool be adequate, and that the sensorimotor consequences of tool action be predictable. A well-designed tool interface (comfortable to grip, responsive to subtle variations in user input, providing clear feedback) facilitates embodiment; a poorly designed tool (awkward to hold, unresponsive, providing ambiguous feedback) resists embodiment and forces the user to maintain explicit conscious attention to tool manipulation[29][42]. This principle explains why certain tool designs persist across centuries while others quickly disappear; good tool design reflects an implicit understanding of the neural and biomechanical constraints on embodiment.

The neural integration of tools involves modification of multiple body representations. Research indicates that tool use engages both the **body schema** (the implicit, sensorimotor representation of bodily boundaries and action capacities) and the **body image** (the consciously available perception of one's body)[29]. Tool use appears to extend the body schema—the implicit sense of where one's body ends—more readily than it modifies the body image. This distinction explains why experienced tool users can perform extraordinarily precise manipulations through a tool without necessarily feeling that the tool "is part of my body" in a consciously accessible way. The tool has been incorporated into the implicit sensorimotor system such that action flows through it naturally, yet the explicit body image might not be substantially modified.

## Software Tools and the Ontology of Immaterial Artifacts

The investigation of tools extends into the domain of software, where the ontological status of artifacts becomes more complex and conceptually challenging[13][27]. Software represents a fundamentally novel category of artifact, one in which implementation is entirely separated from any material substrate in the traditional sense. While software must be instantiated in physical hardware to execute, the software itself is constituted by patterns of information that are substrate-independent; the same software program can run on diverse hardware platforms, different processors, alternative storage media[13]. This substrate independence creates an ontological puzzle: what exactly is software if it is neither purely abstract (like a mathematical theorem) nor a material object (like a computer)?

According to formal ontology approaches to software, software should be classified as a **generically dependent continuant**—an entity that depends on a material substrate for its instantiation but is not identical to any particular material substrate[13]. Software patterns are abstract information structures; they depend on instantiation in material media yet can be multiply instantiated across different material bases. This contrasts with what might be termed **singular dependent continuants** (like holes or surfaces) that depend on a particular material substrate. Software's status as a generically dependent artifact reveals something important: it is constitutively dependent on being **interpreted** or executed on a suitable computing apparatus. The software itself, considered as pure pattern or code, is inert; it becomes functionally active only when instantiated in a computing system capable of executing the instructions it contains[27][30].

The interface-implementation distinction becomes particularly subtle in the software domain. Software tools such as text editors, compilers, or database systems present interfaces to users that are themselves implemented through software. The interface of a text editor—what appears on the screen, how the editor responds to keyboard input, what functions are available through menus—is generated through the software implementation. Unlike a hammer, where the interface (handle and head) is materially distinct from the implementation (internal metal structure), software interfaces are generated dynamically through the same code that constitutes the implementation. Yet ontologically, the interface-implementation distinction remains valid; we can usefully distinguish between what the software does (its interface behavior, what the user encounters) and how it does it (its internal algorithms, data structures, code organization)[27][30].

The distinction between **software libraries** and **software frameworks** illustrates how tool functionality can be organized differently within the software domain[14][17]. A library is a collection of reusable functions and classes that a program can call upon as needed; the programmer's code controls the flow of execution and calls library functions when required. A framework, by contrast, defines the basic structure and flow of control; the programmer's code is called by the framework at specified points. As one explanation states clearly, "the caller/callee relationship defines the difference between the two terms. It is our code which calls the library code while in framework, it is framework's code which calls our code"[14]. This distinction reflects a fundamental difference in the ontological status of the tool relative to the program being developed. A library is a subordinate tool that the programmer controls; a framework is a superordinate structure that controls how the programmer's code fits in. This relationship inverts who is in command of the overall computational process.

### Digital Mediation and Technological Affordances

Software tools exhibit distinctive properties regarding **mediation**—the way tools shape human perception and action in relation to their environment[50]. According to post-phenomenological approaches to technology, tools and technologies are not neutral instruments that simply extend human agency; rather, they actively mediate human-world relations, transforming what becomes perceptible, what courses of action become possible, and what constitutes a meaningful situation[50]. A telescope does not simply magnify distant objects; it makes astronomical phenomena visible in ways that would otherwise be impossible, thereby reshaping astronomical practice itself. Similarly, software tools like geographic information systems (GIS) do not simply represent spatial data more efficiently than maps; they fundamentally alter what spatial relationships become visible and what forms of spatial reasoning become possible[50].

This principle of technological mediation applies forcefully to software tools. A search engine does not merely retrieve information that exists independently; it shapes what information becomes relevant to a query and how information comes to be structured and organized. A word processor does not simply transcribe thoughts into text; it transforms the writing process itself, making certain revisions and reorganizations trivial while others become costly, thereby shaping the evolutionary development of written work. These mediating effects are not peripheral to tool function but rather constitutive of how software tools reshape human practice and human understanding. Any adequate ontology of software tools must account for this mediating dimension—the way tools don't simply serve pre-existing human purposes but rather help constitute what those purposes are and how they can be pursued[50].

## Tool Taxonomy: Classification Schemes and Essential Features

Existing literature in anthropology, archaeology, and engineering provides multiple taxonomies for classifying tools, each reflecting different ontological commitments about what constitutes a tool's essential nature. Archaeological classification systems typically organize tools by morphological features (shape, size, material composition) or by inferred function based on wear patterns and contextual evidence[19][22]. These classification schemes assume that tools can be identified and distinguished based on observable physical characteristics, an approach that works well for prehistoric stone tools where functional purpose must be inferred from form alone. However, such morphological classifications frequently obscure the actual functions tools were used for, since form does not unambiguously determine function; the same shaped stone could have been used for cutting, scraping, or crushing depending on specific contexts[19].

Hilpinen's triadic classification system distinguishes between three fundamental categories within the broader field of tool-like objects: **instruments** (naturally occurring objects used for a purpose but not modified, such as a stone picked up to use as a hammer), **tools** (intentionally modified objects designed for a purpose, such as a shaped stone hammer), and **artifacts** (tools that are designed to be recognized as deliberately crafted implements)[48]. This threefold distinction captures the recognition that there exists a spectrum from natural objects used as tools, through crafted implements, to designed artifacts whose purpose is explicitly encoded in their form. Yet this classification system, while elegant, cannot account for all relevant cases; many objects that we unambiguously call tools might not strictly satisfy all the criteria Hilpinen proposes.

A more comprehensive approach, developed in contemporary artifact philosophy, recognizes that tools are characterized by a clustering of properties rather than a single essential feature[45][48][49]. Essential features of tools might include: (1) **intentional production** by an agent or community; (2) **material modification** of natural substances; (3) **functional purpose** that the tool is designed to serve; (4) **structural features** that enable or constrain function; (5) **recognizable form** that communicates the tool's purpose; (6) **historical placement** within practical traditions and communities of use. Not all of these features need be present to the same degree in every tool, and different tools might emphasize different subsets of these features. A highly refined tool such as a violin might emphasize structural sophistication and recognizable form highly, while a simple tool like a walking stick might require minimal structural refinement yet achieve equal functional adequacy[45].

### Essential Versus Accidental Properties of Tools

The philosophical distinction between **essential properties** (those that something must have to be the kind of thing it is) and **accidental properties** (those that it happens to have but could lack) proves particularly complex when applied to tools[20][23]. For natural kinds like water, the essential property is molecular composition (H₂O); no matter how water's appearance, state of matter, or context changes, it remains water by virtue of this essential composition. For tools, the situation is fundamentally different. The essential property of a hammer cannot be reduced to any fixed material composition or unchanging physical form, because hammers have been made from stone, bronze, iron, steel, and modern composite materials, and their forms vary substantially across cultures and historical periods[45][48].

Instead, tool essences must be understood through function and intentional design. What makes something essentially a hammer is that it was intentionally designed and produced to drive objects (typically nails) through impact, and that it is recognizable and usable as such within communities of practice. Yet even this functional definition admits of variation; hammers are used not only for driving nails but for breaking apart structures, for stretching metal, for demonstration in classrooms, and for ceremonial purposes. The question becomes: at what point does functional variation become so extensive that we should recognize that a tool has changed its essential nature?

The insight that emerges from contemporary artifact philosophy is that the essence of a tool is not fixed in nature but rather **historically and contextually constituted**[45][48][49]. A tool's essential properties are those features that allow it to be recognized and used as a tool of its kind within relevant communities of practice. As one artifact ontology argument proposes, "an artifact kind identified by a common description or concept can include several subtypes or species," and "commonly used artifact kinds (pens, paper clips, computers, etc.) evolve over time as different authors and designers try to improve earlier artifact types or adapt them to new conditions and purposes"[54]. This evolutionary plasticity of artifact kinds reflects the recognition that tools are not natural kinds discovered in nature; rather, they are social constructions that can be modified, reconceived, and re-designed as circumstances and purposes change.

## The Institutional and Social Dimensions of Tools

The ontological status of tools cannot be fully specified without attending to their **institutional** and **social dimensions**. John Searle's theory of institutional facts provides a framework for understanding how tools derive some of their essential properties from collective agreement and social recognition rather than from their intrinsic material features[43][46]. Searle argues that institutional facts are constituted through the formula: X counts as Y in context C, where X represents a brute (physical) fact, Y represents an institutional (socially meaningful) fact, and C represents the context or institution in which this transformation occurs[43][46]. A piece of printed paper counts as money because a community collectively agrees to treat it as such; without this collective intentionality, the paper would be merely paper.

This framework applies to tools in revealing ways. A hammer is not merely a shaped metal object; it is an implement that counts as appropriate for certain social and practical contexts. In the context of carpentry, an object with certain properties counts as a hammer; in the context of archaeological investigation, a similar-shaped stone object counts as a prehistoric tool; in the context of artistic practice, such an object might count as a sculpture or readymade artwork. The tool's essential nature is partially constituted through these institutional recognitions and social contexts. A hammer is a hammer not only because of its material properties and design but also because communities of practitioners recognize it as such, use it according to established conventions, and teach its use to apprentices within structured traditions[43][46].

This social constitution of tool identity explains why tools can be quite diverse in their physical properties while remaining instances of the same kind. Different cultures and historical periods have produced hammers of widely varying designs, yet they are recognized as hammers because they perform similar functions within similar social contexts and are recognized as such by communities of practitioners. Conversely, the same physical object can count as different kinds of tools depending on the social context in which it appears. A smooth stone might count as a hammer in a carpentry context, a tool for food preparation in a culinary context, or a sculptural material in an artistic context. The tool's identity is constitutively dependent on institutional recognition and social context, not merely on its intrinsic properties[43].

## Mereological and Compositional Ontology of Complex Tools

For more complex tools composed of multiple integrated components, formal ontology must provide frameworks for analyzing how the parts relate to the whole and how the tool's identity depends on mereological structure. The mereological theory developed within BFO and related ontologies distinguishes between different types of part relations and specifies how they apply to artifacts[25][28]. **Continuant part-of** relations hold between parts of objects that persist through time; a hammer's head is a continuant part of the hammer because both the head and the whole hammer endure through time while maintaining identity[25]. Proper parts must be supplemented by other parts; a hammer's head is a proper part because the hammer is necessarily also composed of other parts (the handle) without which it would not constitute a complete hammer[25].

The mereological structure of tools reveals important ontological facts about their identity conditions. A hammer cannot lose its handle and remain a hammer; the handle is an essential part. Likewise, the head cannot be so damaged that it can no longer strike effectively. Yet marginal modifications to these parts preserve hammer identity; replacing the handle with one of different wood species, or reshaping the head slightly to reduce weight, need not change the fact that one still has a hammer. This reveals that tool identity is not sensitive to all mereological properties but only to those mereological structures that affect functional capacity[25][28].

Complex tools composed of many components exhibit what might be termed **functional integration**: the tool works as a unified system only because its parts are properly integrated and coordinated[37][40]. A violin consists of hundreds of component parts (strings, bridge, chin rest, tuning pegs, soundboard), yet it functions as a unified instrument only because these parts are precisely assembled and maintained in specific relationships. The same wooden pieces, if disassembled, no longer constitute a violin; the parts must achieve a particular structural configuration. This functional integration requirement means that complex tools exhibit what might be called **structural holism**: the whole possesses properties and capacities that the parts do not possess in isolation, and the tool's identity depends on maintaining the structural configuration that enables these emergent properties[37][40].

## Extended Embodied Cognition and Tool Affordances

The integration of phenomenological, cognitive scientific, and neuroscientific perspectives on tools converges on the recognition that tools fundamentally reshape human **affordances**—the possibilities for action available within a situation. An affordance is not merely a property of the environment but rather a relational property holding between environmental features and the capacities of an agent[36][42]. Tools expand and transform an organism's affordances by adding new capacities or magnifying existing ones. A broom affords sweeping; without the broom, sweeping is impossible for humans (our hands are not adequately structured to push debris across floors). With the broom, sweeping becomes a natural affordance, something the agent-tool system can readily accomplish.

The phenomenological investigation of embodied cognition reveals that skilled tool users perceive affordances differently than novices[26][42]. An experienced carpenter, walking into a room, perceives wood grain and surface irregularities as objects for specific planes to address; the affordances structured by their mastery of tools become apparent in their perception. A novice perceives only undifferentiated surfaces. This difference is not merely cognitive or psychological; it reflects a genuine restructuring of what the world affords. The tool user, through embodied practice, has developed neural structures that recognize and organize perceptual input in ways that make tool-relevant affordances salient[26][42]. This recognition transforms our understanding of tools from mere external implements to constitutive elements of an extended embodied system that generates novel forms of agency and perception[26].

## Toward an Integrative Ontology of Tools

The investigation of tools across philosophical, cognitive scientific, and formal ontological frameworks reveals that tools constitute a distinctive and irreducible ontological category. Tools are neither purely natural objects (they depend on intentional design and social recognition for their existence) nor purely abstract entities (they depend on material instantiation for their functioning). Rather, tools exemplify what might be termed **situated material-intentional artifacts**—entities whose being is constitutively dependent on an integration of material substrate, designed functional capacity, embodied practices, and social-institutional contexts. No single domain of inquiry can provide a complete ontological account; rather, philosophy must integrate insights from phenomenology (concerning lived embodied experience), cognitive science (concerning extended mental processes), formal ontology (concerning categorical structures), and social theory (concerning institutional constitution).

The analysis further reveals that the ontological status of tools is not static or unchanging but rather emerges through dynamic processes of use, appropriation, redesign, and social recognition. Tools do not possess fixed essences but rather exemplify what might be termed **evolved essences** that reflect histories of intentional modification and collective agreement within communities of practice. A tool's being is constitutively open to transformation; as new uses are discovered, as materials are varied, as designs are improved, the tool's essential properties shift while continuity of function and recognition is maintained. This processual ontology of tools stands in marked contrast to the classical essentialist picture, which treats essences as fixed and unchanging properties inhering in individual objects independent of social and historical context.

The integration of physical tools and software tools within a single ontological framework reveals deep structural similarities beneath apparent differences. Both physical tools and software tools present interfaces through which users interact; both have implementations (material or algorithmic) that users typically do not perceive directly; both achieve their functional purposes through integration within practices of use; both become incorporated into extended cognitive and embodied systems through sufficient practice. Yet software tools also exhibit distinctive properties: their substrate independence, their capacity to be infinitely replicated without loss, their dynamic and malleable character, the way they can be precisely specified through formal language, and their integration into information infrastructures. These distinctive features do not render software ontologically incommensurate with physical tools but rather reveal that the tools category encompasses considerable internal diversity.

## Conclusion: Toward Pragmatic Realism About Tool Ontology

This comprehensive investigation demonstrates that tools are not simple, univocal entities possessing a fixed essence independent of context and use. Instead, the ontological status of tools emerges through an integration of several distinct factors: their material substrate and physical properties, their designed functional capacities, their modes of embodied use and incorporation into human practice, their social and institutional recognition within communities, and their capacity to generate novel affordances and possibilities for action. Any adequate ontology of tools must acknowledge this multidimensional character and avoid the reductionist temptation to define tools by reference to a single essential property (such as material composition, historical function, or formal design specification).

The phenomenological investigation of Heidegger and subsequent thinkers establishes that tools achieve their distinctive mode of being through an interplay of ready-to-hand transparency (where the tool becomes incorporated into practice and disappears from explicit awareness) and present-at-hand visibility (where the tool becomes an object of explicit attention and examination). This oscillation between transparent use and explicit attention reveals that the tool's being is not fixed but rather emerges through processes of practical engagement. Graham Harman's object-oriented reinterpretation further suggests that even in their most engaged, transparent use, tools maintain a withdrawn reality that exceeds any particular functional role or relational context.

The cognitive scientific perspective, particularly the extended mind thesis, reveals that tools are not merely external instruments that agents use to achieve predetermined goals; rather, tools constitute cognitive processes themselves and help generate the very goals and capacities that shape human action. Through embodied practice, tools become incorporated into neural systems and body schema in ways that transform what becomes perceivable and actionable. Michael Polanyi's analysis of tacit knowledge illuminates how this incorporation proceeds largely implicitly; skilled tool users possess knowledge of their tools that cannot be fully articulated but rather remains embedded in embodied capacities developed through practice.

Formal ontology provides systematic categorical frameworks for analyzing tools as dependent continuants, as artifacts whose existence and properties partly depend on human intention, and as entities whose mereological structure is sensitive to functional requirements. The distinction between essential and accidental properties applies differently to tools than to natural kinds, reflecting the recognition that tool essences are historically and socially constituted rather than fixed in nature. The interface-implementation distinction proves applicable across both physical and software tools, revealing deep structural similarities despite apparent differences in material substrate.

The social and institutional dimensions of tools, elucidated through Searle's theory of institutional facts, demonstrate that tools derive some of their essential properties from collective agreement and social recognition. A hammer is a hammer not only because of intrinsic properties but because communities recognize and use it as such within established practices. This institutional dimension explains the evolutionary plasticity of tool kinds and the capacity of tools to transform their meaning and application as social contexts change.

Looking forward, an integrative ontology of tools must synthesize these diverse perspectives into a coherent framework that acknowledges both the material and social dimensions of tool being, the embodied character of tool use, the extended cognitive processes that tools enable, and the formal structures through which tools can be categorized and analyzed. Such an ontology will reject both naive realism (which treats tools as simple material objects with fixed properties) and radical constructivism (which treats tools as purely conventional creations without material constraints). Instead, it will recognize tools as entities whose being emerges through the dynamic integration of material properties, functional design, embodied practice, cognitive extension, and social-institutional constitution. This pragmatic realism about tools acknowledges both the objective constraints imposed by material substrates and physical laws and the genuine ways in which human intention, practice, and social agreement help constitute what tools are and what they can do. Only through such integrated analysis can philosophy adequately account for the remarkable diversity of tools across human history and across the natural world, from the first deliberately shaped implements to the most sophisticated software systems that now mediate human cognition itself.
