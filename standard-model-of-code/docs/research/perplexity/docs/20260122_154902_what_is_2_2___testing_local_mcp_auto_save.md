## Query

What is 2+2? (Testing local MCP auto-save)

---

## Response

**2 + 2 equals 4.**[1][4]

This is a basic arithmetic addition of two integers, where the sum is confirmed through direct calculation: start with 2, add another 2, resulting in 4.[1] Multiple sources, including educational platforms and math blogs, affirm this as the standard result in conventional mathematics.[1][4]

Other results discuss unrelated ambiguities, such as order of operations in phrases like "half of 2 + 2" (yielding 3 or 2 depending on interpretation),[2][5] or non-standard contexts like complex numbers.[3] References to 2 + 2 = 5 are rhetorical or sophistical, not mathematically valid in base-10 arithmetic.[6][7]
