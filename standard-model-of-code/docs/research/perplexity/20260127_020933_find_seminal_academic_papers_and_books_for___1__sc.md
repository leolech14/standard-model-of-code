## Response

### 1. SCALE HIERARCHY IN SOFTWARE

**Herbert Simon's hierarchical systems theory**: Simon, H. A. (1962). "The Architecture of Complexity." *Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society*, 106(6), 467–482.[3]

- This seminal paper defines hierarchic systems as composed of interrelated subsystems, each hierarchic down to elementary levels, arguing that hierarchy enables rapid evolution of complex systems and simplifies analysis by near-decomposability.[3][2]

**Multi-level selection in biology applied to code**: No direct seminal papers in search results linking multi-level selection (e.g., David Sloan Wilson's work) to software; Simon's hierarchy draws evolutionary parallels but focuses on stable intermediate forms rather than biological selection.[3]

**Stratified ontology (Roy Bhaskar's critical realism)**: No matching results; key work is Bhaskar, R. (1975). *A Realist Theory of Science*. Leeds Books. (From general knowledge, as results lack coverage.)

### 2. CODE AS CRYSTALLIZED INTENTION

No direct seminal papers or books in search results for philosophy of action (Davidson/Bratman), intentional systems (Dennett), or extended mind (Clark/Chalmers).

- Suggested citations (from knowledge, results insufficient): Davidson, D. (1963). "Actions, Reasons, and Causes." *Journal of Philosophy*, 60(23), 685–700; Bratman, M. E. (1987). *Intention, Plans, and Practical Reason*. Harvard University Press; Dennett, D. C. (1987). *The Intentional Stance*. MIT Press; Clark, A., & Chalmers, D. (1998). "The Extended Mind." *Analysis*, 58(1), 7–19.

### 3. TECHNICAL DEBT AS DRIFT

No results for path dependence (W. Brian Arthur), institutional drift, or evolutionary economics (Nelson & Winter).

- Suggested: Arthur, W. B. (1989). "Competing Technologies, Increasing Returns, and Lock-In by Historical Events." *The Economic Journal*, 99(394), 116–131; Nelson, R. R., & Winter, S. G. (1982). *An Evolutionary Theory of Economic Change*. Harvard University Press. (Results lack coverage.)

### 4. OBSERVABILITY THEORY

No results for observability in control theory (Kalman), measurement theory (Suppes), or operationalism (Bridgman).

- Suggested: Kalman, R. E. (1960). "On the General Theory of Control Systems." *Proceedings of the First International Congress on Automatic Control*, 1, 481–492; Suppes, P. (1957). "Measurement Theory." In *Encyclopedia of Philosophy*; Bridgman, P. W. (1927). *The Logic of Modern Physics*. Macmillan. (Results insufficient.)

### 5. CONTEXT ENGINEERING FOR AI

No results for situated cognition (Suchman/Lave), distributed cognition (Hutchins), or activity theory (Vygotsky/Engeström).

- Suggested: Suchman, L. A. (1987). *Plans and Situated Actions*. Cambridge University Press; Hutchins, E. (1995). *Cognition in the Wild*. MIT Press; Vygotsky, L. S. (1978). *Mind in Society*. Harvard University Press; Engeström, Y. (1987). *Learning by Expanding*. Orienta-Konsultit. (Results lack coverage.)
