## Open Concerns

### HIGH PRIORITY

| ID | Concern | Impact | Status | Action |
|----|---------|--------|--------|--------|
| OC-009 | **Scope Leakage** | Core count 2,809 >> Expected 1,179 (+138%) | **BUG** | Check if exclusion lists fail to load or `include_all=True` default |
| OC-001 | **Test failures in pattern_matcher.py** | 11 tests fail due to missing `tree_sitter` | ENVIRONMENT | Pin `tree-sitter>=0.20,<0.22` in requirements.txt + fallback |
| OC-010 | **88 skipped tests unexplained** | ~40% of test suite skipped silently | INVESTIGATE | Audit skip reasons, ensure no critical logic hidden |
| OC-002 | **Pipeline snapshot lacks per-stage node counts** | Navigator shows timing but not deltas | ENHANCEMENT | Instrument `snapshot.py` per-stage |
| OC-003 | **Pyright type errors in full_analysis.py** | ~10 type issues | TECH_DEBT | Policy: `# type: ignore` if fix >30 min |

### MEDIUM PRIORITY

| ID | Concern | Impact | Status | Action |
|----|---------|--------|--------|--------|
| OC-004 | Physics behavior differs between Atom/File views | File view has `forceCenter(0,0,0)`, Atom doesn't | INVESTIGATE | Reproduce: toggle views, compare forces |
| OC-005 | Node count variance (2787→2807→2809) | ~0.7% drift between runs | MONITORING | Track in CI, establish baseline |
| OC-006 | Pipeline Navigator stage names mismatch | `stage_2_5` vs `stage_2.5` format | COSMETIC | Update `build_pipeline_snapshot()` |

### LOW PRIORITY

| ID | Concern | Impact | Status | Action |
|----|---------|--------|--------|--------|
| OC-007 | Unused variable warnings in sidebar.js (line 818, 828) | TypeScript lint | COSMETIC | Remove unused `active` vars |
| OC-008 | `snapshot.py` has unused FieldDelta/sample functions | Dead code | TECH_DEBT | Wire up or remove |

### RESOLVED (Fixed)

> ACI correctness audit (2026-01-24). Discovered by Codex, fixed by Claude.

| ID | Concern | Priority | Status |
|----|---------|----------|--------|
| OC-011 | ACI: HYBRID tier returned by routing but had no execution path in `analyze.py` (silent fall-through to internal-only) | HIGH | FIXED (`522d9e2`) |
| OC-012 | ACI: invalid set names emitted by semantic matching could crowd out valid sets, causing silent context loss | HIGH | FIXED (`522d9e2`) |
| OC-013 | Perplexity membrane missing: local repo context was injected into external search query, polluting retrieval | HIGH | FIXED (`522d9e2`) |
| OC-014 | Agent context triggers too generic ("run", "task", "confidence") → false positives | MEDIUM | FIXED (`522d9e2`) |
| OC-015 | ACI set cap applied before sanitization + FLASH_DEEP missing sanitization → valid sets dropped | MEDIUM | FIXED (`10e4001`) |

**Commits:**
- `522d9e2`: Phase 1 ACI correctness (set sanitization, HYBRID execution, Perplexity membrane, trigger refinement)
- `10e4001`: Pre-cap removal + FLASH_DEEP sanitization (bundled with elevation fix)

**Validation:** `--tier hybrid` smoke run + set sanitization debug + pytest (354 passed)

## Strategic Gaps (Phase Blockers)

> These block roadmap progress, not just code quality.

### CRITICAL (Blocks Phases)

| ID | Gap | Blocks | Status | Path Forward |
|----|-----|--------|--------|--------------|
| SG-001 | **Reachability bottleneck (29.3%)** | Phase 3-4 | BLOCKING | Expand entrypoint detection, improve call resolution |
| SG-002 | **Phase 2 (Resolution) not started** | Phase 3 | NOT_STARTED | Call resolver improvements, import strictness |
| SG-003 | **Health Model A-component** | Phase 5 | UNIMPLEMENTED | Formula exists (H=10×(0.25T+0.25E+0.25Gd+0.25A)), alignment scoring missing |
| SG-004 | **Task Registry → BARE loop** | Auto-refinement | PROPOSED | P1-Critical in SUBSYSTEM_INTEGRATION.md, needs tasks.yaml polling |

### IMPORTANT (Reduces Capability)

| ID | Gap | Impact | Status | Path Forward |
|----|-----|--------|--------|--------------|
| SG-005 | **UPB documented but unintegrated** | Visualization intelligence | 13:0 docs:code | Wire to HTML generation |
| SG-006 | **BARE 40% missing** | Inference pipeline | CrossValidator + ConceptMapper = 0% | Implement or descope |
| SG-007 | **Centripetal Scan blocked** | Strategic insights | API quota | Budget allocation or batch mode |
| SG-008 | **Cross-language (TS/JS) unscoped** | Phase 8 | ZERO implementation | Tree-sitter JS/TS grammars |

### MINOR (Tech Debt)

| ID | Gap | Impact | Status |
|----|-----|--------|--------|
| SG-009 | Wave-Particle asymmetry | 81/100 Silver | 19 docs without code, 8 code undocumented |
| SG-010 | Terminology (Attributes vs Lenses) | Phase 5 deliverable | Model.md uses both inconsistently |
| SG-011 | Perplexity not in HSL loop | External research | --enable-external-search proposed (P2) |

## Known Limitations

### Pipeline Navigator

- **No per-stage node/edge counts** - Only captures timing, not data flow deltas
- **Static stage layout** - Hardcoded PIPELINE_PHASES array, doesn't adapt to actual stages
- **No stage drill-down** - Clicking stages shows placeholder data only

### File View

- **Camera delay** - 100ms setTimeout for camera restore may cause brief flicker
- **Physics reset** - File graph applies different forces than atom graph

### Node Count Ground Truth

- **Tolerance:** ±10% from canonical counts
- **Scope ambiguity:** "Core" vs "Full" depends on what's included in analysis

---

## Technical Debt

### Type System

**Policy:** Add `# type: ignore` to legacy analysis code if fix takes >30 mins. Prioritize velocity over perfection.

```bash
# Verify type errors:
pyright src/core/full_analysis.py

# Known issues:
#   - Line 1025: CodebaseState not defined
#   - Lines 1171-1180: UnifiedAnalysisOutput.get() issues
#   - Lines 1182, 1187: nodes/edges possibly unbound
```

### Module Dependencies

```bash
# Check if tree_sitter is installed:
python -c "import tree_sitter; print('OK')"

# Fix: Add to requirements.txt OR implement graceful fallback
# pattern_matcher.py: 11 tests skip/fail without tree_sitter
```

## Monitoring Metrics

| Metric | Expected | Actual | Delta | Status |
|--------|----------|--------|-------|--------|
| Core node count | 1,179 | 2,809 | **+138%** | CRITICAL - OC-009 |
| Full node count | 1,961 | 2,809 | +43% | INVESTIGATE |
| Pipeline stages | 27 | 24 | -11% | CHECK |
| Test pass rate | >95% | 92.5% | -2.5% | ACCEPTABLE |

---

## Next Session Priorities

1. **OC-009: Investigate scope leakage** - Check if exclusion lists load, verify `include_all` defaults
2. **OC-001: Fix tree_sitter dependency** - Pin `tree-sitter>=0.20,<0.22` AND implement fallback
3. **OC-010: Audit 88 skipped tests** - Ensure no critical logic hidden behind skips
4. **OC-004: Investigate physics inconsistency** - Align forces between Atom/File views
5. **OC-002: Add per-stage node counts** - Instrument snapshot.py with before/after tracking

## Reference: Ground Truth Node Counts

| Scope | Count | What It Includes |
|-------|-------|------------------|
| **Collider Core** | ~1,179 | Python analysis engine + pipeline stages |
| **Collider Full** | ~1,961 | Core + JavaScript visualization |
| **With Tests** | ~2,353 | Full + test suite |
| **Everything** | ~2,787 | All code in repo |
