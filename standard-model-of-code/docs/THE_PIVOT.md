# The Pivot: From "Artificial Intelligence" to "Code Physics"

## 📅 December 23, 2025: The 100% Coverage Breakthrough

### The Initial Hypothesis
The project began with the assumption that software mapping is a **Learning Problem**. We believed that:
1.  Code is ambiguous.
2.  Naming is inconsistent.
3.  We need an LLM or Active Learning loop to "guess" and "learn" what a `UserHandler` or `ProductManager` really is.
4.  We built `LearningEngine`, `AutoPatternDiscovery`, and `LLMClassifier` to solve this ambiguity.

### The Experimental Result
We ran the system on **91 repositories** (270,000+ nodes), including massive codebases like PyTorch.
We achieved **100% coverage** with **0 unknowns**.

### The Discovery
We did not need "Intelligence" to achieve this. We achieved it because **Code has Topology**.

We discovered that software engineering is not a chaotic creative writing exercise; it is a structured discipline with physical laws.
*   **The Framework Law:** A function decorated with `@app.get` is *always* a Controller.
*   **The Inheritance Law:** A class inheriting from `BaseModel` is *always* a DTO.
*   **The Topology Law:** A file inside `/test/` is *always* a Test.

### The Conclusion
We successfully refuted our own need for AI.
We proved that **Structure + Behavior > Syntax**.

### The Pivot
We are transitioning the codebase from an "AI Experiment" to a "Deterministic Static Analysis Tool".
*   **Archiving:** `LLMClassifier` (The Brain)
*   **Archiving:** `LearningEngine` (The Student)
*   **Promoting:** `HeuristicClassifier` (The Detective)
*   **Promoting:** `UniversalDetector` (The Physicist)

The **Standard Code Model** is not a model that learns; it is a model that *knows*, because code cannot exist outside of these laws without breaking.
