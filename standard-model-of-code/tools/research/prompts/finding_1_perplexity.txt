CONTEXT NEEDED FOR: Pareto Distribution Claim in Code Structure Analysis

We are validating a research claim that:
"The top-4 structural code types (functions, classes/aggregates, variables, modules) account for 70-90% of nodes in typical codebases."

Our empirical data from 4 open-source repos (Python, Go, TypeScript) shows:
- Top-4 mass median: 98.81%
- Range: 96.43% to 100.0%

TASKS (External Context Only - NOT validating our internal metrics):

1. LITERATURE: Find academic papers or industry reports on:
   - Distribution of code elements (functions, classes, variables) in software
   - Pareto/power-law distributions in software metrics
   - Static analysis coverage patterns

2. METHODOLOGY: Are there standard methodologies for:
   - Measuring code element distributions
   - Validating structural claims across language/domain strata

3. COMPARABLE WORK: Has anyone made similar claims about:
   - A small set of code types dominating codebase structure
   - Universal patterns in code organization across languages

4. NOVELTY: Is this claim pattern:
   - Well-established (cite prior art)
   - Novel (no significant prior work)
   - Contested (contradicting evidence exists)
