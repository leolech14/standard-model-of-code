ASSUMPTIONS: What implicit assumptions could be wrong?\n\n2. METHODOLOGY BIAS: What could make these results artificially high?\n\n3. STATISTICS: Is 4 repos enough? What's suspicious about 96-100% range?\n\n4. FALSIFICATION TESTS: Design 3 specific tests that could disprove this claim:\n   - What repo types might break the pattern?\n   - What languages might be different?\n   - What edge cases should be tested?\n\n5. VERDICT: Would this survive peer review? (Yes/Probably/Unlikely/No) with reasoning.\n\nReason from the data. Be skeptical."
