FINDING 1: Pareto Distribution of Structural Atoms

CLAIM: The top-4 structural atoms (LOG.FNC.M, ORG.AGG.M, DAT.VAR.A, ORG.MOD.O) account for 70-90% of nodes across analyzed codebases.

EVIDENCE FROM CORPUS RUN (2026-01-22):
- Repos analyzed: 4 (instructor, httpx, cobra, zod)
- Languages: Python, Go, TypeScript
- Total nodes: 4,971

METRICS:
- Top-4 mass median: 98.81%
- Top-4 mass range: [96.43%, 100.0%]
- Top-4 CI lower bound: 96.43%
- Unknown rate median: 0.3%
- Unknown rate range: [0.2%, 0.42%]

TASK: Validate the evidence chain for Finding 1.

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Cite specific file paths and line numbers from the research tooling
2. Verify the metrics computation logic in atom_coverage.py
3. Check if the claim wording ("70-90%") matches the observed metrics (96-100%)
4. Identify any gaps or confounders in the evidence
5. Assess whether 4 repos is sufficient for the claimed scope

OUTPUT FORMAT:
## Observation
[What the data shows - cite specific artifacts]

## Interpretation
[What this means for the Pareto hypothesis]

## Gaps Identified
[Any methodological gaps or confounders]

## Wording Assessment
[Does the claim accurately reflect the data?]

## Confidence
[0-100% with justification]

## Limitations
[What this analysis cannot tell us]
