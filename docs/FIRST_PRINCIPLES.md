# 🍎 First Principles (The Primer)
**Resolution: Extremely Low**
**Concepts: 3**

You asked to see the bottom of the well.
Here are the three absolute truths that exist before everything else.

## 1. THE PARTICLE (Code is Matter)
Stop reading code as text. Start seeing it as **Physical Stuff**.
*   A variable is not a word; it is a **Box**.
*   A loop is not a keyword; it is a **Spiral**.
*   A function is not a definition; it is a **Machine**.

**The Truth:**
Your software is not a story. It is a structure made of 130 distinct types of bricks ("Atoms").
If you have too many bricks in one pile, it falls over.
If you use the wrong brick (e.g., a "Wood" brick in a "Fire" engine), it burns.

## 2. THE LAW (Structure has Rules)
In the real world, Gravity pulls things down. You cannot turn it off.
In Code, there are also invisible forces ("Laws") that you cannot ignore without consequence.

*   **Gravity (Dependency):** Heavy things (Databases) act effectively only when distinct from light things (Logic).
*   **Magnetism (Purity):** Some things repel side-effects. If you force them together, they fight.

**The Truth:**
You don't "decide" architecture. You "discover" the laws of physics that already exist.
If a distinct Command tries to return Data, it violates a Law. It's like trying to make water flow uphill.

## 3. ANTIMATTER (The Violation)
What happens when you break a Law?
You create **Antimatter**.

*   It is code that *looks* like code, but behaves like a bomb.
*   A "Stateless Service" that holds state? **Antimatter**.
*   A "Value Object" that changes? **Antimatter**.

**The Truth:**
Antimatter is unstable. It radiates complexity. It attracts bugs.
The goal of this entire system is not to "lint" your code.
It is to finding where you accidentally created Antimatter, so you can annihilate it before it annihilates you.

**That is all.**
Matter. Laws. Antimatter.
Everything else is just details.
