## Abstract

We present the **Standard Model of Code**, a comprehensive framework for representing, classifying, and analyzing software systems as multi-dimensional graph structures. Drawing inspiration from particle physics taxonomy, we propose a hierarchical ontology comprising **167 atomic code constructs** organized into **12 families** across **4 phases**, measured along **8 orthogonal semantic dimensions**. We map these atoms to **152 Tree-Sitter AST node types** across JavaScript, TypeScript, and Python.

We implement this model in the **Collider** tool and validate it against **35,263 code entities** across 3 production codebases, achieving **100% classification coverage** with zero unmapped constructs. The framework identifies architectural violations, God Functions, semantic duplicates, and refactoring opportunities. Initial manual inspection suggests high face validity; a formal precision study is planned future work.

**Keywords:** software architecture, static analysis, graph theory, semantic classification, code quality

## 1. Introduction

The fundamental challenge of modern software engineering is not writing code—it is **understanding code**. As systems grow in complexity, the ability to navigate, reason about, and modify existing codebases becomes the limiting factor in development velocity.

Traditional approaches rely on two extremes:

1. **Textual analysis** — treating code as natural language (fast but shallow)
2. **Full semantic analysis** — building complete type systems and execution traces (deep but intractable)

We propose a **middle path**: a graph-theoretic semantic model that captures the essential structure of software without requiring full program execution.

### Key Insight

> The useful unit of software is not the file—it is the **entities inside files** (functions, classes, types) and the **relationships between them** (calls, imports, inheritance).

### Contributions

1. A **167-atom ontology** for classifying code constructs
2. An **8-dimensional coordinate system** for semantic properties
3. A **4-level scale hierarchy** (Atom, Molecule, Organism, Ecosystem)
4. **152 Tree-Sitter AST node mappings** for language-agnostic extraction
5. **Empirical validation** on 35,263 code entities with 100% coverage
6. The **Collider** implementation demonstrating practical application

## 2. The Standard Model

### 2.1 Units and Mappings

This section defines the foundational units and their relationships.

> **Definition U1 (AST Observation).**
> For a language λ, Tree-Sitter parsing yields an Abstract Syntax Tree T<sub>λ</sub>. Each AST node n ∈ T<sub>λ</sub> has a *kind*, token span, and a local syntactic neighborhood (parent, children, field names). AST nodes are **observations**—the raw data from which we infer semantics.

> **Definition U2 (Atomic Semantic Construct / Atom).**
> Let **A** be the finite set of **167 atom types**. An atom type a ∈ A is a *language-agnostic semantic construct* that cannot be replaced by a fixed composition of other atom types without losing information required to infer at least one of the 8 semantic dimensions or to evaluate at least one antimatter law. Atoms are **semantic labels**.

> **Definition U3 (Atom Assignment Function τ).**
> Atom assignment is **not** a function of node type alone. Context is required because syntax is polysemous (e.g., a `call_expression` can be an IO call or a pure calculation). We define:
>
> **τ<sub>λ</sub> : (n, ctx(n)) → (a, c)**
>
> where n is an AST node, ctx(n) is a context descriptor (parent chain, field labels, syntactic role, tokens), and (a, c) is an atom type with confidence c ∈ [0, 1].
>
> **Example 1 (Python Decorator):** A `decorator` AST node with ctx containing `@property` → atom `Getter` (confidence 0.95).
>
> **Example 2 (TypeScript Call):** A `call_expression` with ctx matching `*.repository.save(...)` → atom `ImpureFunction` with **Effect** dimension inferred as `Write` (confidence 0.85).
>
> **Example 3 (Fallback):** Any unmatched `function_definition` → atom `Function` (confidence 0.50).

> **Definition U4 (Particles and Scales).**
> A *particle* is a semantic unit at one of four scale levels:
>
> ℓ(p) ∈ { Atom, Molecule, Organism, Ecosystem }
>
> Atoms correspond to assigned atom types on individual AST observations. Molecules and organisms are obtained by *structural aggregation rules* over AST containment (e.g., function bodies, class definitions, module scopes). Particles are **graph nodes**.

### 2.2 Scale Levels

Particles exist at four levels of granularity:

| Level | Name | Description | Examples |
|-------|------|-------------|----------|
| L1 | **Atom** | Indivisible unit | Variable, Literal, Expression |
| L2 | **Molecule** | Composed of atoms | Function, Method, Handler |
| L3 | **Organism** | Composed of molecules | Class, Module, Service |
| L4 | **Ecosystem** | The whole system | Package, Repository |

### 2.3 The 12 Families (167 Atoms)

Atoms group into 12 families across 4 phases:

![Taxonomy Chart](paper_charts/fig1_taxonomy.png)

**Figure 1.** The 167-atom taxonomy organized by phase and family. LOGIC phase dominates with 61 atoms, reflecting the primacy of behavioral constructs in software.

| Phase | Families | Atoms | Description |
|-------|----------|------:|-------------|
| **DATA** | Bits, Bytes, Primitives, Variables | 26 | The matter of software |
| **LOGIC** | Expressions, Statements, Control, Functions | 61 | The forces of software |
| **ORGANIZATION** | Aggregates, Services, Modules, Files | 45 | The structure of software |
| **EXECUTION** | Handlers, Workers, Initializers, Probes | 35 | The dynamics of software |
| **TOTAL** | 12 families | **167** | |

#### Definition 1 (Atom)

An **atom** is a language-agnostic semantic construct that:
- Maps to one or more Tree-Sitter AST node types
- Belongs to a family with code of form `PHASE.FAMILY.SCALE` (e.g., `LOG.FNC.M` for Functions)
- Cannot be decomposed without losing semantic information essential to the 8-dimensional model

> **Note:** Atoms within the same family share a family code. Individual atoms are distinguished by name within their family (e.g., `LOG.FNC.M::PureFunction`, `LOG.FNC.M::AsyncFunction`).

### 2.4 The 8 Dimensions

Every particle is measured across 8 orthogonal semantic dimensions:

![Dimensions Radar](paper_charts/fig5_dimensions.png)

**Figure 2.** The 8-dimensional semantic coordinate system. WHAT (167 types) provides the richest discrimination; State (2 types) provides the coarsest.

| # | Dimension | Domain | Values |
|---|-----------|--------|--------|
| 1 | **WHAT** | Atom types | 167 types (see §2.2) |
| 2 | **Layer** | Architectural position | Interface, Application, Core, Infrastructure, Test |
| 3 | **Role** | Functional purpose | Orchestrator, Data, Worker, Utility |
| 4 | **Boundary** | Connection type | Internal, Input, I/O, Output |
| 5 | **State** | Memory behavior | Stateful, Stateless |
| 6 | **Effect** | Side effects | Pure, Read, Write, ReadModify |
| 7 | **Activation** | Trigger mechanism | Direct, Event, Time |
| 8 | **Lifetime** | Temporal scope | Transient, Session, Global |

#### Definition 2 (Dimension)

Each dimension D is a partial function returning a value and confidence score:

```
D: Particle → Domain(D) × [0,1]
```

Dimensions are **conceptually orthogonal**: the value of one dimension cannot be deterministically derived from others.

---

## 3. Antimatter Detection

A key principle is **antimatter detection**: identifying impossible combinations of dimensional values.

### Definition 3 (Antimatter Law)

An antimatter law is a first-order constraint over particles, dimensions, and edges:

```
∀p ∈ Particles: Effect(p) = Pure ⇒ ¬∃q: (p, WRITES, q) ∈ Edges
```

### 3.1 Constraint Language

> **Definition A1 (Antimatter Constraint Language).**
> An antimatter law is a formula in a restricted first-order fragment:
>
> - **Particle variables**: p, q
> - **Dimension predicates**: e.g., Effect(p) = Pure, Layer(p) = Core
> - **Edge predicates**: Edge(p, t, q) where t ∈ T<sub>E</sub>
> - **Graph metrics**: Degree(p) > k

> **Definition A2 (Violation with Confidence).**
> A violation is reported only when minimum confidence exceeds threshold τ:
>
> min(conf(D₁(p)), ... conf(Dₖ(p))) ≥ τ ⇒ report_violation
>
> Otherwise, the finding is flagged as "suspected" with reduced severity. Default τ = 0.55.

### Canonical Antimatter Laws

| # | Law | Violation Type |
|---|-----|----------------|
| 1 | Pure function with WRITES edges | Effect contradiction |
| 2 | Stateless service with mutable fields | State contradiction |
| 3 | Core layer depending on Interface layer | Layer violation |
| 4 | Value Object with setter methods | Immutability violation |

### Detection Results

## 4. Graph Representation

### 4.1 Formal Graph Model

> **Definition G1 (Particle Graph).**
> A software system is represented as a typed directed multigraph:
>
> **G = (P, E)**
>
> where P is a set of particles and E ⊆ P × T<sub>E</sub> × P with edge types:
>
> T<sub>E</sub> = { CONTAINS, CALLS, IMPORTS, INHERITS, IMPLEMENTS, READS, WRITES }

> **Definition G2 (Containment Well-Formedness).**
> The restriction E<sub>CONTAINS</sub> is acyclic and defines a forest. This corresponds to Property 2.

> **Definition G3 (Scale Constraint).**
> If (p, CONTAINS, q) ∈ E then ℓ(q) < ℓ(p). An atom contains nothing.

### 4.2 Node Properties

Each particle is a **node** with properties:

```
Node: {
  id: string,
  name: string,
  kind: AtomType,
  file: string,
  in_degree: number,
  out_degree: number,
  dimensions: {
    layer: Layer,
    role: Role,
    effect: Effect,
    ...
  }
}
```

### Edge Types

| Edge | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| CONTAINS | Parent holds child | Class → Method |
| CALLS | Function invokes function | handleApi → syncConnection |
| IMPORTS | Module depends on module | app.tsx → utils.ts |
| INHERITS | Class extends class | UserService → BaseService |
| IMPLEMENTS | Class realizes interface | Repository → IRepository |
| READS/WRITES | Data access | function → database |

## 5. Implementation: Collider

The 5-layer pipeline:

1. **PARSING** (Tree-Sitter): Extract AST from source files
2. **GRAPH BUILDING**: Construct nodes and edges
3. **HEURISTIC CLASSIFICATION**: Pattern matching for 30+ semantic rules
4. **LLM ESCALATION**: AI inference for low-confidence cases (<55%)
5. **OUTPUT GENERATION**: JSON, Mermaid diagrams, Markdown reports

### 5.2 LLM Escalation Protocol

When heuristic confidence is below threshold (τ < 0.55), classification is escalated to an LLM with a structured prompt:

1. **Prompt Determinism**: Fixed prompt templates are used (no user-input injection). Model version and temperature (T=0) are logged.
2. **Privacy**: Symbol names, signatures, docstrings, and bounded code excerpts (≤200 lines) are sent. Full repositories are never transmitted. Local models (Ollama) are supported for air-gapped environments.
3. **Caching**: LLM responses are cached by content hash; identical inputs yield identical outputs.
4. **Ablation**: Heuristics-only mode achieves 100% coverage with lower average confidence (65% vs 85%). LLM escalation improves confidence without changing coverage.

### 5.3 Language Support

| JavaScript | 91 | ~95% |
| TypeScript | 107 | ~95% |
| Python | 62 | ~90% |
| **Total (Union)** | **152** | — |

*Note:* 152 is the union of distinct AST node kinds across the three languages after removing syntactic duplicates. Per-language counts are language-specific.

## 6. Empirical Evaluation

### 6.1 Validation Dataset

We validated the 167-atom taxonomy against 3 codebases:

![Validation Chart](paper_charts/fig2_validation.png)

**Figure 4.** Validation dataset: 35,263 code entities across 3 codebases. 100% mapped to the 167-atom taxonomy.

| Codebase | Language | Files | Entities | Coverage |
|----------|----------|------:|--------:|----------|
| Poetry | Python | 436 | 1,284 | 100% |
| Collider | Python+JS | 8,411 | 24,654 | 100% |
| ATMAN | Node.js | 178 | 9,325 | 100% |
| **Total** | — | **9,025** | **35,263** | **100%** |

> **Clarification (Entities vs Nodes):** "Entities" refers to Molecule and Organism-level particles (functions, classes, modules). "Nodes" in the graph table includes all particles at every scale, including atoms.

**Result:** Zero unmapped constructs across all codebases.

### 6.2 Phase Distribution

![Distribution Chart](paper_charts/fig3_distribution.png)

**Figure 5.** Phase distribution of 35,263 code entities. LOGIC (75.1%) dominates, reflecting the behavioral nature of software.

| Phase | Entities | Percentage |
|-------|--------:|-----------:|
| LOGIC | 26,476 | 75.1% |
| ORGANIZATION | 8,173 | 23.2% |
| EXECUTION | 614 | 1.7% |

> **Clarification (DATA Phase):** DATA-phase constructs (primitives, literals) exist at the Atom scale. The "Entities" metric counts only Molecules/Organisms, hence DATA is not represented in this distribution.

### 6.3 Graph Metrics

![Graph Metrics](paper_charts/fig4_graph_metrics.png)

**Figure 6.** Graph complexity by codebase. Edge-to-node ratio ranges from 1.6 (ATMAN) to 2.3 (Poetry), indicating varying coupling density.

| Codebase | Nodes | Edges | E/N Ratio |
|----------|------:|------:|----------:|
| Poetry | 3,441 | 7,860 | 2.28 |
| Collider | 49,471 | 79,494 | 1.61 |
| ATMAN | 18,655 | 29,689 | 1.59 |

### 6.4 Key Findings (ATMAN Case Study)

| Finding | Metric | Implication |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| God Function | `handleApi` (489 calls) | Single point of failure |
| God Component | `App.tsx` (2,908 lines) | Decomposition needed |
| Semantic Duplicates | 1,102 groups | Consolidation opportunity |
| Structural Duplicates | 48 groups | Shared utility extraction |

*Note:* These findings were validated via developer review. Formal precision metrics are planned.

### 6.5 Evaluation Protocol (Planned)

To formally validate accuracy beyond coverage, we propose the following research questions:

**RQ1 (Atom Assignment Correctness)**: Sample 500 AST observations stratified by language/family. Human annotators label the correct atom type. Report precision and Cohen's κ.

**RQ2 (Dimension Correctness)**: Sample 300 particles (functions/classes). Human annotators label Layer, Role, Effect, State. Report per-dimension accuracy.

**RQ3 (Antimatter Law Precision)**: For top 50 violations per law, maintainers rate True/False/Unclear. Report precision per law.

**Orthogonality Check**: Compute pairwise mutual information between dimensions across the full dataset. Low MI (≤ 0.15 bits) supports the orthogonality claim.

### 6.6 Threats to Validity

**Internal Validity**: LLM-assisted classification introduces potential non-determinism. We mitigate this with fixed prompts, T=0, and caching.

**External Validity**: Validation is limited to Python/JS/TS codebases. Generalization to other languages requires further study.

**Construct Validity**: "Correctness" of atom assignment depends on labeler agreement. Inter-rater reliability will be reported.

## 7. Related Work

This work draws from and extends several established research areas:

### 7.1 Code Property Graphs

Yamaguchi et al. [6] introduced **Code Property Graphs (CPGs)**, which unify AST, CFG, and PDG into a single graph representation for vulnerability mining. Our model differs in emphasis: CPGs prioritize data flow for security analysis; we prioritize *semantic role classification* for architecture conformance.

### 7.2 Architecture Conformance (Reflexion Models)

Murphy et al. [7] proposed **Reflexion Models**, comparing an *extracted source model* to an *intended high-level model* to identify architectural drift. Our antimatter laws serve a similar function but operate directly on measured semantic dimensions rather than requiring a separate intended model.

### 7.3 Code Smell Detection

Tools like SonarQube, CodeQL, and Joern detect specific code smells via pattern matching. Our 8-dimensional framework generalizes this: smells become *constraint violations* over a unified semantic space, enabling compositional and novel smell definitions.

### 7.4 Our Contribution

We combine:
- A **fixed semantic basis** (167 atoms) providing stable vocabulary
- **8 orthogonal dimensions** for multi-faceted classification
- **Multi-scale hierarchy** (Atom → Ecosystem)
- **Antimatter laws** as declarative architectural constraints

This allows semantic architecture analysis without requiring full CFG/PDG construction.

## 8. Theoretical Properties

### Property 1 (Totality)

Every Tree-Sitter AST node of interest maps to at least one atom in A.

### Property 2 (Well-Formedness)

The CONTAINS edge relation forms a forest with unique roots:

```
(P, E_CONTAINS) is acyclic ∧ each component has unique root
```

### Property 3 (Monotonicity)

Adding files cannot invalidate existing dimension assignments:

```
S ⊆ S' ⇒ ∀p ∈ S: D(p)_S = D(p)_S'
```

### Property 4 (Compositionality)

Organism-level dimensions derive from constituent molecules:

```
State(organism) = Stateful ⟺ ∃m ∈ molecules(organism): State(m) = Stateful
```

---

## 9. Conclusion

The **Standard Model of Code** provides a principled, graph-theoretic framework for understanding software structure. By treating code as **matter with measurable properties across 8 dimensions**, we enable systematic detection of architectural patterns and violations.

The physics metaphor provides a memorable vocabulary. The true value lies in the underlying graph model:
- **Nodes** represent entities
- **Edges** represent relationships  
- **Dimensions** capture semantic meaning
- **Antimatter laws** encode architectural constraints

### Future Work

1. **Extended language support** (Java, Go, Rust, C++)
2. **Automated refactoring** based on antimatter detection
3. **GraphRAG integration** for codebase Q&A
4. **IDE plugins** for real-time architectural feedback
