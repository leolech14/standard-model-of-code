# 📜 Standard Model v14.0 Changelog
**Date:** 2025-12-14
**Operator:** The Professor

## 🚀 The Upgrade (Canonical Expansion)
We have successfully merged the Dark Matter into the Standard Model.

*   **Previous Count (v13):** 130 Atoms
*   **New Count (v14):** 167 Atoms
*   **Net New Matter:** 37 Fundamental Particles

## 📉 The Mass Defect (192 vs 167)
You calculated **192** (130 + 62).
The Final Canon is **167**.
**Where did the 25 atoms go?**

**Consolidation.**
We discovered that 25 of the "Unknown" patterns were actually existing Known Atoms appearing under slightly different signatures.
*   *Example:* `import_statement` (Known) vs `import` keyword (Unknown).
*   *Action:* Merged into the single canonical definitions.
