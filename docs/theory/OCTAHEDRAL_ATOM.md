## The Complete Model

```
                    16 ABSTRACTION LEVELS (L-3 to L12)
                           ↑
                           │
    L12 (Universe) ────────┼──────── ◆ (octahedron at this level)
    L11 (Ecosystem)        │
    L10 (System)           │         Each level contains
    L9 (Application)       │         octahedral atoms with
    ...                    │         8 faces of metadata
    L3 (Node) ─────────────┼──────── ◆ ← most common analysis level
    ...                    │
    L-3 (Bit)              │
                           ↓
```

**The 8 Faces (Horizontal):**

```
200 ATOM TYPES   → Face 1 (WHAT)
5 LAYERS         → Face 2 (LAYER: Interface/App/Core/Infra/Test)
33 ROLES         → Face 3 (ROLE)
4 BOUNDARIES     → Face 4 (BOUNDARY: Internal/Input/I-O/Output)
2 STATES         → Face 5 (STATE: Stateful/Stateless)
4 EFFECTS        → Face 6 (EFFECT: Pure/Read/Write/ReadModify)
3 LIFECYCLES     → Face 7 (LIFECYCLE: Create/Use/Destroy)
0-100%           → Face 8 (TRUST)
```

**The 16 Abstraction Levels:**

| Level | Name | Example |
|-------|------|---------|
| L12 | Universe | All code everywhere |
| L11 | Ecosystem | npm, PyPI |
| L10 | System | Distributed system |
| L9 | Application | Single app |
| L8 | Subsystem | Bounded context |
| L7 | Package | Module/library |
| L6 | File | Source file |
| L5 | Section | Class/region |
| L4 | Block | Function body |
| **L3** | **Node** | **Statement/expression** ← atom level |
| L2 | Token | Identifier/literal |
| L1 | Character | Single char |
| L0 | Bit-sequence | Binary |
| L-1 | Bit | Single bit |
| L-2 | Electron | Logical gate |
| L-3 | Qubit | Quantum state |

Every instance of a code construct is an **octahedron at a specific level** carrying 8 pieces of metadata.

## Geometry

| Property | Count | Meaning |
|----------|-------|---------|
| **Faces** | 8 | The 8 dimensions of analysis |
| **Vertices** | 6 | Maximum intersection points |
| **Edges** | 12 | Relationships between dimensions |

---

## The 8 Faces (Dimensions)

Each face of the octahedron carries one dimension of metadata:

| Face | Dimension | Question | Data Type |
|------|-----------|----------|-----------|
| **1** | WHAT | What is this? | Atom type (1 of 200) |
| **2** | LAYER | Where in architecture? | Interface/App/Core/Infra/Test |
| **3** | ROLE | What's its purpose? | Role name (1 of 33) |
| **4** | BOUNDARY | Does it cross boundaries? | Internal/Input/I-O/Output |
| **5** | STATE | Does it maintain state? | Stateful/Stateless |
| **6** | EFFECT | Does it have side effects? | Pure/Read/Write/ReadModify |
| **7** | LIFECYCLE | In what phase? | Create/Use/Destroy |
| **8** | TRUST | What's the confidence? | 0-100% |

---

## The 6 Vertices (Intersection Points)

The vertices represent maximum dimensional overlap:

| Vertex | Position | Intersecting Dimensions |
|--------|----------|-------------------------|
| **V1** | Top | STATE + LAYER + WHAT + ROLE |
| **V2** | Bottom | EFFECT + BOUNDARY + LIFECYCLE + TRUST |
| **V3** | Front | WHAT + STATE + EFFECT + BOUNDARY |
| **V4** | Back | ROLE + STATE + EFFECT + TRUST |
| **V5** | Left | LAYER + STATE + EFFECT + LIFECYCLE |
| **V6** | Right | BOUNDARY + STATE + EFFECT + TRUST |

---

## The 12 Edges (Dimensional Relationships)

Each edge represents a valid question combining two dimensions:

1. STATE ↔ WHAT: "What state does this type hold?"
2. STATE ↔ ROLE: "How does state relate to purpose?"
3. STATE ↔ EFFECT: "What effects does state cause?"
4. EFFECT ↔ WHAT: "What effects does this type produce?"
5. EFFECT ↔ ROLE: "How do effects serve purpose?"
6. WHAT ↔ ROLE: "What types fulfill this role?"
7. LAYER ↔ BOUNDARY: "Which layers cross which boundaries?"
8. LAYER ↔ LIFECYCLE: "How does layer affect lifecycle?"
9. BOUNDARY ↔ TRUST: "What trust for boundary-crossing code?"
10. LIFECYCLE ↔ TRUST: "How does lifecycle affect confidence?"
11. ROLE ↔ LAYER: "What roles exist at each layer?"
12. WHAT ↔ LAYER: "What atom types at each layer?"

---

## Opposed Faces (Dual Dimensions)

Opposite faces represent complementary perspectives:

| Face 1 | Face 2 | Duality |
|--------|--------|---------|
| STATE | EFFECT | Internal ↔ External |
| WHAT | ROLE | Structure ↔ Purpose |
| LAYER | BOUNDARY | Position ↔ Transition |
| LIFECYCLE | TRUST | Time ↔ Confidence |

## Why Octahedron?

1. **Exactly 8 faces** - Perfect for 8 dimensions
2. **Dual of cube** - Mathematical elegance (cube has 8 vertices, 6 faces)
3. **Symmetric** - All faces are equilateral triangles
4. **No privileged face** - All dimensions are equally accessible
5. **Natural for visualization** - Easy to render, rotate, inspect

## Atom Data Structure

```json
{
  "id": "example_function",
  "type": "Function",
  "octahedron": {
    "WHAT": "LOG.FNC.M",
    "LAYER": "Application",
    "ROLE": "Controller",
    "BOUNDARY": "Input",
    "STATE": "Stateless",
    "EFFECT": "ReadModify",
    "LIFECYCLE": "Use",
    "TRUST": 0.87
  }
}
```

## Implications

### 1. Every Atom is Complete
Every atom carries all 8 dimensions. No dimension is optional.

### 2. Analysis is Rotation
Analyzing code through different dimensions is like rotating the octahedron to see different faces.

### 3. Unknown is Valid
A face value of "Unknown" means that dimension hasn't been analyzed yet, not that it doesn't exist.

### 4. Edges are Questions
The 12 edges generate 12 cross-dimensional questions we can ask about any atom.
