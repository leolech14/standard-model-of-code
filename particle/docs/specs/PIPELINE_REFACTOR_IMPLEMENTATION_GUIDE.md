## PHASE 1: FOUNDATION (4 Steps)

Foundation tasks create the abstract framework that all stages will inherit from.

### Step 1.1: Create BaseStage Abstract Base Class

**Objective:** Define the interface all 25 pipeline stages must implement.

**File:** `src/core/pipeline/base_stage.py` (NEW)

**Line Count:** ~70 lines

**Dependencies:** None

**Pattern Reference:** `src/core/edge_extractor.py:415` (`EdgeExtractionStrategy` ABC)

**Code to Write:**

```python
"""
BaseStage: Abstract base class for all pipeline stages.

Pattern: Follows EdgeExtractionStrategy(ABC) from edge_extractor.py:415
Implements standard interface for all 25 pipeline stages.
"""

from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
from typing import TYPE_CHECKING

if TYPE_CHECKING:
    from ..data_management import CodebaseState


class BaseStage(ABC):
    """Abstract base class for all pipeline stages.

    Every stage in the pipeline must:
    1. Inherit from BaseStage
    2. Set a `name` attribute (human-readable, matches StageTimer label)
    3. Implement the `execute()` method
    4. Call `validate_input()` before processing
    5. Return the modified state (same object in Phase 2, new object in Phase 4)

    Invariants:
        - Must have a `name` attribute (matches StageTimer label)
        - Must implement `execute(state) -> state`
        - Phase 2: Can mutate state (wrap existing functions)
        - Phase 4: Must not mutate (return new state)

    Example:
        class MyStage(BaseStage):
            name = "my_stage"

            def execute(self, state: CodebaseState) -> CodebaseState:

        Returns:
            True if valid, False otherwise

        Note:
            Default implementation returns True (permissive).
            Override to add stage-specific validation.

    def __repr__(self) -> str:
        """String representation for debugging."""
        return f"<{self.__class__.__name__} name={self.name!r}>"
```

**Validation Command:**

```bash
python -c "from src.core.pipeline.base_stage import BaseStage; print('✓ BaseStage imported successfully')"
```

**Expected Output:**
```
✓ BaseStage imported successfully
```

**Rollback (if validation fails):**
```bash

### Step 1.2: Create Pipeline Package Structure

**Objective:** Organize stage implementations into a proper Python package.

**File:** `src/core/pipeline/__init__.py` (NEW)

**Line Count:** ~30 lines

**Dependencies:** Step 1.1

**Code to Write:**

```python
"""
Pipeline: Class-based stage orchestration for Collider.

Structure:
    base_stage.py   - BaseStage ABC
    manager.py      - PipelineManager orchestrator
    stages/         - Concrete stage implementations
        __init__.py - Stage registry and exports
        discovery.py - File discovery stages
        extraction.py - AST and edge extraction stages
        analysis.py - Scope, control flow, data flow stages
        classification.py - Atom and role classification stages
        metrics.py - Graph metrics, Markov, RPBL stages
        advanced.py - Knot detection, purpose field stages
        output.py - Output and report generation stages
"""

from .base_stage import BaseStage
from .manager import PipelineManager

__all__ = [
    "BaseStage",
    "PipelineManager",
]
```

**Create the directory structure:**

```bash
mkdir -p src/core/pipeline/stages
touch src/core/pipeline/__init__.py
touch src/core/pipeline/stages/__init__.py
```

**Validation Command:**

```bash
python -c "from src.core.pipeline import BaseStage, PipelineManager; print('✓ Pipeline package structure OK')"

**Expected Output:**
```
✓ Pipeline package structure OK

### Step 1.3: Define PipelineManager Orchestrator

**Objective:** Create the central orchestrator that runs all 25 stages in sequence.

**File:** `src/core/pipeline/manager.py` (NEW)

**Line Count:** ~160 lines

**Dependencies:** Step 1.1, `data_management.py`, `observability.py`

**Pattern Reference:** `src/core/observability.py:45` (PerformanceManager pattern)

**Code to Write:**

```python

Responsibilities:
    1. Load or create initial CodebaseState
    2. Execute stages in sequence

from src.core.pipeline.base_stage import BaseStage
from src.core.data_management import CodebaseState

# Quick validation: manager can be instantiated
print('✓ PipelineManager imports successfully')
"
```

**Expected Output:**
```
✓ PipelineManager imports successfully
```

**Rollback (if validation fails):**
```bash
rm src/core/pipeline/manager.py
```

---

### Step 1.4: Verify CodebaseState Exists

**Objective:** Confirm CodebaseState is already implemented (100% pre-existing).

**File:** `src/core/data_management.py:106` (VERIFY EXISTING)

**Status:** ALREADY EXISTS - No action needed

**Verification Command:**

```bash
python -c "
from src.core.data_management import CodebaseState
cs = CodebaseState(target_path='/tmp')
print(f'✓ CodebaseState exists and instantiates successfully')
print(f'  - target_path: {cs.target_path}')
print(f'  - has metadata: {hasattr(cs, \"metadata\")}')
print(f'  - has load_initial_graph: {hasattr(cs, \"load_initial_graph\")}')
"
```

**Expected Output:**
```
✓ CodebaseState exists and instantiates successfully
  - target_path: /tmp
  - has metadata: True
  - load_initial_graph: True
```

**Note:** If CodebaseState doesn't exist, this signals a critical environment issue. Do not proceed.

---

## PHASE 2: STAGE WRAPPERS (25 Steps)

Wrap each of the 25 existing pipeline functions as a class inheriting from BaseStage.

**High-Level Pattern for Each Stage:**

```python
# In src/core/pipeline/stages/[domain].py

from ..base_stage import BaseStage
from ..state import CodebaseState
from ...full_analysis import original_function  # Import existing function

class MyStage(BaseStage):
    """Description matching StageTimer label."""

    name = "Stage N: Description"

    def execute(self, state: CodebaseState) -> CodebaseState:
        # Call existing function (preserve logic, wrap in class)
        result = original_function(state.nodes, state.edges, ...)

        # Update state and return
        state.nodes = result['nodes']
        state.edges = result['edges']
        return state
```

### Step 2.1-2.25: Wrap All 25 Stages

**File Organization:**

| File | Stages | Line Count |
|------|--------|-----------|
| `discovery.py` | 1 | ~40 |
| `extraction.py` | 2, 2.5 | ~80 |
| `analysis.py` | 2.7, 2.8, 2.9, 2.10, 2.11, 7 | ~200 |
| `classification.py` | 2.12, 2.13 | ~100 |
| `metrics.py` | 5, 6, 6.5, 6.6, 6.8 | ~150 |
| `advanced.py` | 3, 4, 6, 8.5, 8.6 | ~180 |
| `output.py` | 9, 10, 11, 11b, 12 | ~120 |

**Total Phase 2:** ~870 lines across 7 files

**Implementation Strategy:**

**PRIORITY 1 (Complete First):**
- Stage 1: Base Analysis
- Stage 2: Standard Model Enrichment
- Stage 3: Purpose Field
- Stage 4: Execution Flow
- Stage 9: Roadmap Evaluation
- Stage 11b: AI Insights (optional)
- Stage 12: Output Generation

**PRIORITY 2 (Complete Second):**
- Stage 5: Markov Transition Matrix
- Stage 6: Knot/Cycle Detection
- Stage 7: Data Flow Analysis
- Stage 8: Performance Prediction
- Stage 10: Visual Reasoning
- Stage 11: Semantic Cortex
- Stage 2.5: Ecosystem Discovery

**PRIORITY 3 (Complete Third):**
- Stage 2.7, 2.8, 2.9, 2.10, 2.11 (all sub-stages of #2)
- Stage 3.5, 3.6 (sub-stages of #3)
- Stage 6.5, 6.6, 6.8 (sub-stages of #6)
- Stage 8.5, 8.6 (sub-stages of #8)

**Common Implementation Pattern:**

For each stage, follow this template:

```python
from ..base_stage import BaseStage
from ..state import CodebaseState

class [StageName]Stage(BaseStage):
    """[One-line description from StageTimer label]."""

    name = "[Stage N: Full Description]"

    def execute(self, state: CodebaseState) -> CodebaseState:
        """Execute [stage] analysis on the codebase."""
        # Call the existing function from full_analysis.py
        # Copy data if needed to avoid mutation
        # Update state and return
        return state
```

**Reference Existing Functions:**

Use `grep` to locate existing stage implementations:

```bash
# Find all StageTimer calls in full_analysis.py
grep -n "StageTimer\|with self._timer\|perf_manager\." \
  src/core/full_analysis.py | head -40
```

**Validation After Each Stage:**

```bash
# Quick check that the stage imports
python -c "from src.core.pipeline.stages.discovery import FileDiscoveryStage; print('✓')"

# Run tests to ensure no regression
pytest tests/ -q --tb=line
```

**Expected Output:**
```
✓
<test count> passed
```

**Note:** Due to the large number of stages, implement them in batches (Priority 1 → 2 → 3) and commit after each batch.

---

## PHASE 3: INTEGRATION (3 Steps)

Integrate the new class-based pipeline into existing code.

### Step 3.1: Refactor run_full_analysis() Entry Point

**Objective:** Replace the monolithic function with PipelineManager orchestration.

**File:** `src/core/full_analysis.py:950` (MODIFY EXISTING)

**Current Size:** 2087 lines

**Changes:**
1. Import PipelineManager and stage classes
2. Create initial CodebaseState
3. Instantiate all 25 stages
4. Call manager.run()
5. Convert final state to dict for backward compatibility

**Before (Current Implementation):**

Located at `full_analysis.py:950`:
```python
def run_full_analysis(target_path: str, output_dir: str = None, options: Dict[str, Any] = None):
    """Execute the full 25-stage pipeline."""
    perf_manager = PerformanceManager(verbose=verbose_timing)
    perf_manager.start_pipeline()

    # ... 25 inline stages with StageTimer context managers ...

    return {"nodes": nodes, "edges": edges, ...}
```

**After (New Implementation):**

```python
def run_full_analysis(target_path: str, output_dir: str = None, options: Dict[str, Any] = None):
    """Execute the full 25-stage pipeline using class-based orchestration."""
    from src.core.pipeline import PipelineManager, CodebaseState
    from src.core.pipeline.stages import ALL_STAGES

    # Create initial state
    initial_state = CodebaseState(
        target_path=target_path,
        output_dir=output_dir or os.getcwd(),
        options=options or {}
    )

    # Execute pipeline
    manager = PipelineManager(stages=ALL_STAGES, verbose=verbose_timing)
    final_state = manager.run(initial_state)

    # Backward compatibility: convert to dict
    return final_state.to_dict()
```

**Modifications Checklist:**
- [ ] Add imports at top of file
- [ ] Create CodebaseState from arguments
- [ ] Replace all inline stage code with manager.run()
- [ ] Ensure to_dict() returns same schema as before
- [ ] Test backward compatibility with existing callers

**Validation Command:**

```bash
python -c "
from src.core.full_analysis import run_full_analysis
import tempfile
import os

with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as tmpdir:
    # Create a test Python file
    test_file = os.path.join(tmpdir, 'test.py')
    with open(test_file, 'w') as f:
        f.write('def hello(): pass\n')

    result = run_full_analysis(tmpdir, os.path.join(tmpdir, 'output'))

    # Verify output shape
    assert 'nodes' in result, 'Missing nodes in output'
    assert 'edges' in result, 'Missing edges in output'
    print('✓ run_full_analysis refactor successful')
    print(f'  - Output has {len(result.get(\"nodes\", []))} nodes')
    print(f'  - Output has {len(result.get(\"edges\", []))} edges')
"
```

**Expected Output:**
```
✓ run_full_analysis refactor successful
  - Output has 1 nodes
  - Output has 0 edges
```

**Rollback (if validation fails):**
```bash
# Restore from git
git checkout src/core/full_analysis.py
```

---

### Step 3.2: Update Semantic Models Configuration

**Objective:** Document the new Stage concept in the Holographic Socratic Layer.

**File:** `wave/config/semantic_models.yaml` (MODIFY EXISTING)

**Location:** Add new `pipeline` block under `definitions`

**Code to Add:**

```yaml
# Near the end of the file, add:

pipeline:
  scope: "particle/src/core/**"
  definitions:
    Stage:
      description: "A self-contained processing unit in the analysis pipeline."
      synonyms: ["PipelineStage", "AnalysisStage"]
      role: "Processing"
      invariants:
        - "Must inherit from BaseStage ABC"
        - "Must implement execute(state: CodebaseState) -> CodebaseState method"
        - "Must have a 'name' attribute matching StageTimer label"
        - "Must return modified CodebaseState (same or new object)"
        - "Should not modify input state after Phase 4"
      anchors:
        - file: "particle/src/core/pipeline/base_stage.py"
          pattern: "class BaseStage"
          role: "definition"
        - file: "particle/src/core/pipeline/stages/*.py"
          pattern: "class .*Stage\\(BaseStage\\)"
          role: "implementation"
      queries:
        - "Find all Stage implementations"
        - "Check if Stage inherits BaseStage"
        - "Verify Stage has execute method"

    PipelineManager:
      description: "Orchestrates execution of all stages in sequence."
      role: "Orchestration"
      anchors:
        - file: "particle/src/core/pipeline/manager.py"
          pattern: "class PipelineManager"
```

**Validation Command:**

```bash
python -c "
import yaml

with open('wave/config/semantic_models.yaml', 'r') as f:
    config = yaml.safe_load(f)

assert 'pipeline' in config, 'pipeline block not found'
assert 'Stage' in config['pipeline']['definitions'], 'Stage definition not found'
print('✓ Semantic models updated successfully')
print(f'  - Pipeline definition added')
print(f'  - Stage invariants: {len(config[\"pipeline\"][\"definitions\"][\"Stage\"][\"invariants\"])} rules')
"
```

**Expected Output:**
```
✓ Semantic models updated successfully
  - Pipeline definition added
  - Stage invariants: 4 rules
```

**Rollback (if validation fails):**
```bash
git checkout wave/config/semantic_models.yaml
```

---

### Step 3.3: Create Pipeline Test Suite

**Objective:** Add comprehensive tests for the new pipeline architecture.

**File:** `tests/test_pipeline_stages.py` (NEW)

**Line Count:** ~300 lines

**Test Categories:**

```python
"""
test_pipeline_stages.py

Test suite for class-based pipeline stages.

Categories:
    1. Unit tests for each Stage class
    2. Integration test for PipelineManager
    3. Regression test comparing old vs new output
    4. Performance benchmark

## PHASE 4: CLEANUP (3 Steps)

Remove side effects and improve immutability.

### Step 4.1: Remove Mutation Side Effects

**Objective:** Eliminate state mutations by copying data before modification.

**Pattern:** Use `dict.copy()` before modifying node/edge attributes.

**Mutation Points to Fix (30+ locations):**

| Stage | Line | Current | Fix |
|-------|------|---------|-----|
| Markov | 731, 734 | `edge['markov_weight'] = ...` | `edge = edge.copy(); edge['markov_weight'] = ...` |
| RPBL | 1022-1025 | `node['rpbl_*'] = ...` | Copy before assign |
| Scope | 1117 | `node['scope_analysis'] = ...` | Copy before assign |
| Control Flow | 1174, 1186-1189 | `node['control_flow'] = ...` | Copy before assign |
| Atoms | 1251, 1264-1265 | `node['detected_atoms'] = ...` | Copy before assign |
| Data Flow | 1328 | `node['data_flow'] = ...` | Copy before assign |
| Graph Metrics | 1489-1519 | `node['in_degree'] = ...` | Copy before assign |

**Refactoring Pattern:**

**Before (Mutating):**
```python
def extract_graph_metrics(nodes, edges):
    for node in nodes:
        node['in_degree'] = calculate_in_degree(node, edges)
        node['out_degree'] = calculate_out_degree(node, edges)
    return nodes
```

**After (Non-Mutating):**
```python
def extract_graph_metrics(nodes, edges):
    result_nodes = []
    for node in nodes:
        node_copy = node.copy()
        node_copy['in_degree'] = calculate_in_degree(node, edges)
        node_copy['out_degree'] = calculate_out_degree(node, edges)
        result_nodes.append(node_copy)
    return result_nodes
```

**Implementation Steps:**

1. For each mutation point in `full_analysis.py`:
   - Find the line number (listed in table above)
   - Add `.copy()` before modifying
   - Append modified copy to result list instead of modifying in-place

2. Update stage wrapper to use the non-mutating version

3. Test that output is identical

**Validation Command:**

```bash
# Run tests to ensure no behavioral change
pytest tests/ -q --tb=line

# Compare old vs new output
python -c "
# TODO: Implement regression test comparing old vs new
print('✓ Mutation side effects removed')
"
```

**Expected Output:**
```
<test count> passed
✓ Mutation side effects removed
```

**Rollback (if validation fails):**
```bash
git diff src/core/full_analysis.py | head -50
git checkout src/core/full_analysis.py
```

---

### Step 4.2: Remove I/O from Processing Stages

**Objective:** Isolate I/O operations (print, file writes) from pure processing stages.

**I/O Violations to Fix:**

| Issue | Location | Fix |
|-------|----------|-----|
| `print()` statements | lines 975-980 | Replace with `logging.info()` |
| `print()` in stage loops | lines 1000+ | Remove or move to manager |
| PerformanceManager init | line 972 | Move to PipelineManager |
| File I/O in Stage 12 | ~line 2028 | Already isolated, keep there |

**Pattern:**

**Before (I/O Mixed with Processing):**
```python
def stage_5_markov(nodes, edges):
    print(f"Computing Markov matrix for {len(edges)} edges...")
    result = {}
    # ... compute ...
    print(f"Done. Found {len(result)} states.")
    return result
```

**After (Pure Processing):**
```python
def stage_5_markov(nodes, edges):
    # No I/O here - pure computation only
    result = {}
    # ... compute ...
    return result
```

**Logging (Optional, if needed):**
```python
import logging

def stage_5_markov(nodes, edges):
    logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
    logger.debug(f"Computing Markov matrix for {len(edges)} edges...")
    result = {}
    # ... compute ...
    logger.debug(f"Done. Found {len(result)} states.")
    return result
```

**Implementation Steps:**

1. Remove all `print()` calls from non-output stages
2. Move PerformanceManager from stage functions to PipelineManager (already done in Step 3.1)
3. Keep I/O only in Stage 12 (Output Generation)

**Validation Command:**

```bash
# Search for print statements in non-output stages
grep -n "print(" src/core/full_analysis.py | grep -v "# Debug\|output\|Stage 12\|Stage 11b"
```

**Expected Output:**
```
(no output - all debug prints removed)
```

**Rollback (if validation fails):**
```bash
git checkout src/core/full_analysis.py
```

---

### Step 4.3: Run Holographic Socratic Audit

**Objective:** Verify that the new pipeline is theoretically compliant.

**Audit Command:**

```bash
# Activate tools environment
cd /Users/lech/PROJECTS_all/PROJECT_elements
source .tools_venv/bin/activate

# Run the audit
python wave/tools/ai/analyze.py --verify pipeline
```

**Expected Output:**

```
Verifying pipeline architecture...

COMPLIANCE CHECKS
═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

✓ All stages inherit from BaseStage
✓ All stages implement execute() method
✓ All stages have 'name' attribute
✓ PipelineManager runs stages in order
✓ No direct state mutations detected
✓ CodebaseState flows through all stages
✓ Output schema matches specification

AUDIT RESULT: COMPLIANT ✓

Confidence Breakdown:
  - Architecture: 98%
  - Immutability: 95%
  - Testability: 97%
  - Maintainability: 96%

Overall: 96% (HIGH CONFIDENCE)
```

**Failure Scenarios:**

If the audit shows non-compliance, investigate the flagged items:

```bash
# Detailed audit
python wave/tools/ai/analyze.py --verify pipeline --verbose

# Check specific stage
python wave/tools/ai/analyze.py --verify pipeline --stage "Stage 5: Markov"
```

**Validation Command (if audit fails):**

```bash
# Manual compliance check
python -c "
from src.core.pipeline import BaseStage, PipelineManager
from src.core.pipeline.stages import ALL_STAGES

# Verify all stages
for stage in ALL_STAGES:
    assert isinstance(stage, BaseStage), f'{stage} not BaseStage'
    assert hasattr(stage, 'execute'), f'{stage} no execute'
    assert hasattr(stage, 'name'), f'{stage} no name'

print('✓ Manual compliance check passed')
print(f'  - {len(ALL_STAGES)} stages verified')
"
```

**Expected Output:**
```
✓ Manual compliance check passed
  - 25 stages verified
```

**Rollback (if audit fails critically):**
```bash
# If there are serious structural issues
git status
# Review changes
git diff src/core/pipeline/
# If needed, reset and re-implement
git checkout src/core/
```

---

## POST-IMPLEMENTATION VALIDATION

After completing all 4 phases, run comprehensive validation:

### Full Test Suite

```bash
cd /Users/lech/PROJECTS_all/PROJECT_elements/particle
pytest tests/ -v --tb=short
```

Expected: All 216+ tests pass.

### Self-Analysis Benchmark

```bash
# Run Collider on itself
./collider full . --output .collider_refactor_validation
```

Expected: Completes in < 20 seconds with no errors.

### Regression Comparison

```bash
# Compare output against known-good baseline
python -c "
import json

# Load new output
with open('.collider_refactor_validation/unified_analysis.json', 'r') as f:
    new_output = json.load(f)

# Verify structure
assert 'nodes' in new_output
assert 'edges' in new_output
assert len(new_output['nodes']) > 0
assert len(new_output['edges']) >= 0

print('✓ Output structure valid')
print(f'  - {len(new_output[\"nodes\"])} nodes')
print(f'  - {len(new_output[\"edges\"])} edges')
"
```

Expected: Valid JSON with expected node/edge counts.

## TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issue: Import Errors for Pipeline Module

**Symptom:** `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'src.core.pipeline'`

**Solution:**
```bash
# Ensure __init__.py exists
ls -la src/core/pipeline/__init__.py

# If missing:
touch src/core/pipeline/__init__.py
touch src/core/pipeline/stages/__init__.py

# Reinstall package in development mode
pip install -e .
```

### Issue: Test Failures After Phase 2

**Symptom:** `AssertionError: Stage N: ... name mismatch`

**Solution:**
```bash
# Verify stage names match StageTimer labels exactly
grep -n "StageTimer\|self._timer\|perf_manager\." src/core/full_analysis.py | \
  grep -o "Stage [^\"]*"

# Update stage names to match exactly
# Example: name = "Stage 5: Markov Transition Matrix" (not just "markov_matrix")
```

### Issue: Performance Regression

**Symptom:** Pipeline takes > 20s for self-analysis

**Possible Causes:**
1. Too much dict copying (Phase 4 side effect)
2. Missing caching in stage implementations
3. Inefficient graph algorithms

**Debug:**
```bash
# Profile the pipeline
python -m cProfile -s cumtime -c "
from src.core.full_analysis import run_full_analysis
import tempfile
run_full_analysis('.')
" 2>&1 | head -20
```

### Issue: State Lost Between Stages

**Symptom:** Nodes or edges disappear after certain stage

**Solution:**
```bash
# Verify each stage is copying and returning state correctly
# Template fix:

class MyStage(BaseStage):
    def execute(self, state):
        # WRONG: return state_dict (loses other data)
        # RIGHT: modify state and return state

        state.nodes = [...]  # Update specific field
        state.edges = [...]  # Update specific field
        return state         # Return entire state object
```
