> The effort to find the basic constituents of computer programs.

## What Is This?

**Standard Model of Code** - A theoretical framework treating code like physics (atoms, dimensions, layers).

**Collider** - The tool that implements the theory, analyzing codebases and producing architectural insights.

## Quick Start

```bash
cd standard-model-of-code
./collider full /path/to/repo --output /tmp/analysis
```
