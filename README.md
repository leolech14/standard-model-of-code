## 👽 The Architecture (Brain & Body)

This repository is structured as a living system, divided into two specialized hemispheres:

### 1. The Brain: `context-management/`
*   **Purpose**: Meta-cognition, Theory, and Intelligence.
*   **Role**: To understand, navigate, and manage the complexity of the code.
*   **Key Components**:
    *   **The Intelligence**: `tools/ai/analyze.py` (Forensic Surgeon & Architect).
    *   **The Memory**: `tools/archive/archive.py` (Cloud Mirror & Registry).
    *   **The Wisdom**: `docs/` (The Standard Model Theory, AI Manuals).

### 2. The Body: `standard-model-of-code/`
*   **Purpose**: Implementation and Physics.
*   **Role**: To execute the theory and run the "Collider".
*   **Key Components**:
    *   **The Collider**: `src/` (The engine that parses code).
    *   **The Specs**: `schema/` (The Atomic Definitions).
    *   **The Lab**: `experiments/` (Prototyping).

## 🚀 Quick Start (The Workflow)

1.  **Sync the Brain**:
    ```bash
    python context-management/tools/archive/archive.py mirror
    ```
    *(Uploads the Code to the Cloud Context)*

2.  **Ask the Architect**:
    ```bash
    .tools_venv/bin/python context-management/tools/ai/analyze.py "Explain the topological structure of this repo" --mode architect
    ```

3.  **Run the Collider**:
    ```bash
    cd standard-model-of-code
    python collider.py
    ```

👉 **[Enter the Standard Model (The Body)](standard-model-of-code/README.md)**
