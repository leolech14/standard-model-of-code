  "vision": {
    "vision_statement": "In 90 days, the codebase will have begun the process of modularizing the `app.js` monolith by introducing a UIManager facade. Initial refactoring efforts will focus on extracting UI-related logic into this facade, establishing clear boundaries, and improving testability in this area. This will set the stage for more comprehensive modularization in subsequent phases, and overall reduce technical debt.",

Dedicate time for code reviews and knowledge sharing to ensure team alignment. Consider using automated refactoring tools to assist with the extraction process. Ensure adequate time for thorough testing after each extraction step."
