# 384 Subhadrons – Pending Generation

Target: 384 subhadrons (342 possible + 42 impossible).

## Current state
- Not yet listed anywhere in-repo.
- The RPBL grid lives in `1440_csv.csv` (1,440 coordinate space) and enumerates 3,888 hadron-specific rows across 96 hadron subtypes, but the reduction rule to `96 × 4 = 384` is not defined.

## To do
- Define the mapping rule from the 1,440 grid to the canonical 384.
- Generate and store `subhadrons_384.csv/json` here, marking the 42 impossible items.
