# Continents (Legacy “12”) – Evidence List (5 present)

From repo data (`1440_csv.csv`, column `continente_cor`) we have 5 macro-region names:
- Data Foundations
- Logic & Flow
- Organization
- Execution
- Foundations

If the model requires 12 “continents”, the missing seven must be sourced from upstream GROK threads or THEORY canvases and added as a machine-readable canon.
