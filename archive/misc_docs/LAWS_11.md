# Constraints (Legacy “11 Laws”) – Status

The project started with an “11 laws” framing. In this workspace we now have a **v1 canonical 11‑constraint list**, but the model is expected to grow beyond 11 as we separate **hard impossibilities** from **soft smells**.

## Known references
- Mentioned in: `THEORY_COMPREHENSIVE_REPORT.md`, canvases (`THEORY_COMPLETE_ORGANIZED_v2.canvas`, etc.), and supporting summaries (`CANVAS_FILES_SUMMARY.md`, `CANVAS_ORGANIZATION_SUMMARY.md`).

## What exists (canonical v1)
- `spectrometer_v12_minimal/LAW_11_CANONICAL.md`
- `spectrometer_v12_minimal/LAW_11_CANONICAL.json`

## Next step
- Decide and encode:
  - which constraints are **hard laws** (produce “forbidden archetypes”)
  - which constraints are **soft smells** (severity-ranked)
- If/when the canonical constraint set grows past 11, keep this file as a “legacy framing” note and point to the canonical machine-readable list.
