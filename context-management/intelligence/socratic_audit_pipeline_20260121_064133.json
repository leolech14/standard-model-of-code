Extracts calls by traversing the AST. It uses `JSModuleResolver` for resolving module names, but the core logic for extraction is still AST based and doesn't involve complex semantic reasoning about code behavior.\n- **Deviation**: N/A\n\n- **Entity**: `TypeScriptTreeSitterStrategy`\n- **Status**: Compliant\n- **Evidence**: Operates on AST (`body_source` parsed as AST). Extracts calls by traversing the AST.\n- **Deviation**: N/A\n\n- **Entity**: `JSModuleResolver`\n- **Status**: Non-Compliant\n- **Evidence**: While it operates on raw file content, the `JSModuleResolver` performs complex reasoning to resolve module references and aliases. It infers relationships between files based on import statements, window exports, and CommonJS/ES6 module patterns.  This goes beyond simple data ingestion and enters the realm of semantic analysis.\n- **Deviation**: The resolver performs complex semantic reasoning to resolve module references, violating the invariant. Although it operates on the text of the files, the analysis it performs is a form of reasoning.\n\n- **Entity**: `extract_call_edges`\n- **Status**: Partially Compliant\n- **Evidence**: Orchestrates the edge extraction process. It leverages the strategies above. The core of this function orchestrates other functions, some of which are compliant while others are not. Since JSModuleResolver is a key part of the process, it is considered partially compliant.\n- **Deviation**: Since it uses `JSModuleResolver`, the invariant is broken, as the function uses components that perform reasoning. The main role is still to orchestrate the process based on AST information.\n```",
