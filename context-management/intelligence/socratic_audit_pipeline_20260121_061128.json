It also directly modifies local variables like `nodes` and `edges` which are passed between \"stages\".\n- **Deviation**: Does not inherit from a `BaseStage` class. Does not implement an 'execute' or 'run' method as a class would. Modifies local variables. It is a function that encapsulates the entire analysis, not a single stage.\n",
