It has a method `extract_edges` that operates on a particle and a `particle_by_name` dictionary. The particles contain raw file content, and `particle_by_name` is an indexing mechanism. `extract_edges` returns a list of edges, which are the relationships between code elements. It does not perform complex semantic reasoning.\n- **Deviation**: N/A\n\n- **Entity**: `PythonEdgeStrategy`\n- **Status**: Compliant\n- **Evidence**: This class inherits from `EdgeExtractionStrategy` and implements the `extract_edges` method. It uses regular expressions to find function calls and attribute accesses in the `body_source` of a particle, extracting edges based on raw file content. The logic is heuristic-based, not semantic reasoning.\n- **Deviation**: N/A\n\n- **Entity**: `JavascriptEdgeStrategy`\n- **Status**: Compliant\n- **Evidence**: Inherits from `EdgeExtractionStrategy`. Uses regular expressions to find function calls and new instantiations in JavaScript code, extracting edges based on raw file content. The logic relies on patterns, not semantic reasoning.\n- **Deviation**: N/A\n\n- **Entity**: `TypeScriptEdgeStrategy`\n- **Status**: Compliant\n- **Evidence**: Inherits from `JavascriptEdgeStrategy`. No new logic is added.\n- **Deviation**: N/A\n\n- **Entity**: `GoEdgeStrategy`\n- **Status**: Compliant\n- **Evidence**: Inherits from `EdgeExtractionStrategy`. Uses regular expressions to find function calls in Go code, extracting edges based on raw file content. The logic relies on patterns, not semantic reasoning.\n- **Deviation**: N/A\n\n- **Entity**: `RustEdgeStrategy`\n- **Status**: Compliant\n- **Evidence**: Inherits from `EdgeExtractionStrategy`. Uses regular expressions to find function calls in Rust code, extracting edges based on raw file content. The logic relies on patterns, not semantic reasoning.\n- **Deviation**: N/A\n\n- **Entity**: `DefaultEdgeStrategy`\n- **Status**: Compliant\n- **Evidence**: Inherits from `EdgeExtractionStrategy`. Returns an empty list of edges.\n- **Deviation**: N/A\n\n- **Entity**: `TreeSitterEdgeStrategy`\n- **Status**: Compliant\n- **Evidence**: This class extracts edges based on parsing the `body_source` as an AST. It uses tree-sitter queries for call detection. This is still operating on raw file content, though in a parsed form. `extract_callee_name` extracts function/method names from call nodes in AST. It does not perform complex semantic reasoning.\n- **Deviation**: N/A\n\n- **Entity**: `PythonTreeSitterStrategy`\n- **Status**: Compliant\n- **Evidence**: Uses `TreeSitterEdgeStrategy` to parse python code with tree-sitter.\n- **Deviation**: N/A\n\n- **Entity**: `JavaScriptTreeSitterStrategy`\n- **Status**: Compliant\n- **Evidence**: Uses `TreeSitterEdgeStrategy` to parse javascript code with tree-sitter. Has member call and callback extraction. `extract_member_call` extracts method names based on AST node properties, this is extraction based on raw content.\n- **Deviation**: N/A\n\n- **Entity**: `TypeScriptTreeSitterStrategy`\n- **Status**: Compliant\n- **Evidence**: Uses `TreeSitterEdgeStrategy` to parse typescript code with tree-sitter.\n- **Deviation**: N/A\n",
