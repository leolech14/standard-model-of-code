It orchestrates the full analysis but doesn't inherit from any base Stage class, and its return type is a `Dict`, not a `ProcessingResult/AnalysisResult` object (though the dict contains the results).\n- **Deviation**: Does not inherit from a base `Stage` class and does not return a `ProcessingResult/AnalysisResult` object. Does implement the 'run' functionality, but via a function rather than a class method.\n\n- **Entity**: The individual analysis steps inside `run_full_analysis` (e.g., \"Stage 1: Base Analysis\", \"Stage 2: Standard Model Enrichment\", etc.)\n- **Status**: Non-Compliant\n- **Evidence**: These are conceptual stages within the `run_full_analysis` function, not classes. They do not inherit from a base class or implement an `execute` or `run` method. They are implemented as calls to other functions.\n- **Deviation**: These are not classes and do not fulfill any of the invariants.\n\n- **Entity**: `FileEnricher` (src/core/file_enricher.py - NOT SHOWN)\n- **Status**: Compliant\n- **Evidence**: The `FileEnricher` from `src/core/file_enricher.py`  has an `enrich_boundaries` function and is used as part of building the `file_boundaries`. It is instantiated and the enrich boundary function is called during the full analysis. Returns a standard result format in that `file_boundaries` is modified and returned, which is then used by downstream steps, therefore acting as a result object.\n- **Deviation**: Compliant\n\n- **Entity**: `RoadmapEvaluator` (roadmap_evaluator.py - NOT SHOWN)\n- **Status**: Compliant\n- **Evidence**: The `RoadmapEvaluator`  has an `evaluate` function and is used as part of evaluating the roadmap. It is instantiated and the evaluate function is called during the full analysis. Returns a standard result format in that `roadmap_result` is returned.\n- **Deviation**: Compliant\n\n- **Entity**: `TopologyClassifier` (topology_reasoning.py - NOT SHOWN)\n- **Status**: Compliant\n- **Evidence**: The `TopologyClassifier` has a `classify` function and is used as part of reasoning about topology. It is instantiated and the classify function is called during the full analysis. Returns a standard result format in that `topology_result` is returned.\n- **Deviation**: Compliant\n\n- **Entity**: `ConceptExtractor` (semantic_cortex.py - NOT SHOWN)\n- **Status**: Compliant\n- **Evidence**: The `ConceptExtractor` has an `extract_concepts` function and is used as part of semantic concept extraction. It is instantiated and the `extract_concepts` function is called during the full analysis. Returns a standard result format in that `semantics` is returned.\n- **Deviation**: Compliant\n\n- **Entity**: `ConstraintEngine` (constraint_engine.py - NOT SHOWN)\n- **Status**: Compliant\n- **Evidence**: The `ConstraintEngine` has a `validate_graph` function and is used as part of validation for constraints. It is instantiated and the `validate_graph` function is called during the full analysis. Returns a standard result format in that `constraint_report` is returned.\n- **Deviation**: Compliant\n",
