## Scoring Matrix

| Dimension | Question | Weight |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| **Factual** | Is my understanding of current state correct? | High |
| **Vision** | Does this serve MCP Factory's mission? | High |
| **Current** | Does this fit codebase as it exists? | Medium |
| **Onwards** | Does this fit where we're heading? | Medium |

**Verdicts:** ACCEPT (>75%) | DEFER (50-75%) | REJECT (<50%) | OPTIONAL (context-dependent)

---

## Phase 1 Tasks

### TASK-001: Write BEST_PRACTICES.md

**Proposal:** Create best practices document from Perplexity research.

| Dimension | Score | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Factual | 95% | Have 849-line research + Gemini analysis |
| Vision | 90% | Core to MCP Factory mission |
| Current | 85% | Clear inputs, no blockers |
| Onwards | 90% | Foundation for templates/validation |

**Verdict:** ✓ **ACCEPT** (90% confidence)

---

### TASK-002: Integrate into HSL (semantic_models.yaml)

**Proposal:** Add MCP Factory to Holographic-Socratic Layer validation.

| Dimension | Score | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Factual | 70% | Know the pattern, haven't tested |
| Vision | 95% | Directly solves drift problem |
| Current | 60% | Need to verify HSL still works |
| Onwards | 90% | Critical for long-term maintenance |

**Verdict:** ⏸️ **DEFER** (79% confidence) - Test HSL first with small example

---

### TASK-003: Abstract dual-format save utility

**Proposal:** Extract to `tools/utils/output_formatters.py`.

| Dimension | Score | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Factual | 95% | Working code exists in perplexity_mcp_server.py |
| Vision | 80% | Enables reuse across tools |
| Current | 90% | Simple extraction |
| Onwards | 85% | Gemini recommended this |

**Verdict:** ✓ **ACCEPT** (88% confidence)

---

### TASK-004: Add SHA-256 checksums to auto-save

**Proposal:** Add fixity verification per Perplexity evaluation.

| Dimension | Score | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Factual | 90% | Clear requirement from research |
| Vision | 75% | Nice-to-have, not core mission |
| Current | 95% | Low complexity, hashlib exists |
| Onwards | 80% | Supports archival integrity |

**Verdict:** ✓ **ACCEPT** (85% confidence)

---

### TASK-005: Document CONFIG_PANEL pattern in agent school

**Proposal:** Add to agent_school/WORKFLOWS.md as best practice.

| Dimension | Score | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Factual | 85% | Pattern proven, just needs docs |
| Vision | 70% | Valuable but not core to MCP Factory |
| Current | 60% | Need to locate agent school files |
| Onwards | 75% | Helps future Brain hemisphere tools |

**Verdict:** ⏸️ **OPTIONAL** (73% confidence) - Do after Phase 1 core tasks

---

## Phase 2 Tasks

### TASK-006: Create Python stdio server template

> **⚠️ MIGRATED** → `.agent/registry/active/TASK-001.yaml`

**Proposal:** Create `templates/python_stdio_server/` scaffold.

| Dimension | Score | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Factual | 90% | Have reference implementation |
| Vision | 95% | Core mission - make MCP creation trivial |
| Current | 80% | Need BEST_PRACTICES.md first |
| Onwards | 95% | Foundation for scaffold.py |

**Verdict:** ✓ **MIGRATED** - Now tracked as TASK-001 in .agent/

---

### TASK-007: Create Node.js stdio server template

**Proposal:** Create `templates/node_stdio_server/` scaffold.

| Dimension | Score | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Factual | 30% | No reference implementation |
| Vision | 60% | Expands reach but Python-first project |
| Current | 20% | Would need research |
| Onwards | 50% | Not critical path |

**Verdict:** ✗ **REJECT** (40% confidence) - Defer indefinitely, Python-first

---

### TASK-008: Build tools/scaffold.py

**Proposal:** Interactive generator for new MCP servers.

| Dimension | Score | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Factual | 60% | Clear concept, UX undefined |
| Vision | 90% | Key to "MCP in <5 min" goal |
| Current | 50% | Need template first |
| Onwards | 85% | Critical for adoption |

**Verdict:** ⏸️ **DEFER** (71% confidence) - After TASK-006 (template)

---

## Phase 3 Tasks

### TASK-009: Build tools/validate.py

**Proposal:** Compliance tester for MCP servers.

| Dimension | Score | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Factual | 50% | Need BEST_PRACTICES.md to know what to validate |
| Vision | 85% | Critical for quality |
| Current | 40% | Blocked by TASK-001 |
| Onwards | 90% | Automates enforcement |

**Verdict:** ⏸️ **DEFER** (66% confidence) - After TASK-001

---

### TASK-010: Build tools/registry.py

**Proposal:** Track deployed MCP servers.

| Dimension | Score | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Factual | 40% | Scope unclear - what to track? where? |
| Vision | 70% | Useful for multi-server management |
| Current | 30% | No immediate need (only 1 server) |
| Onwards | 60% | Value increases with scale |

**Verdict:** ⏸️ **DEFER** (50% confidence) - Revisit when we have 3+ servers
