  "summary": "Friston's 2010 paper presents the free-energy principle as a unified theory for understanding perception, action, and learning in biological systems. The principle states that any self-organizing system that resists dispersal must minimize its free energy, which is an information-theoretic bound on surprise. The paper demonstrates how this single principle explains hierarchical brain organization, predictive coding, attention, action selection, and learning. Free energy minimization occurs through two complementary processes: perception (updating internal models to better predict sensory input) and action (changing sensory input to match predictions). The framework unifies Bayesian brain hypotheses, predictive coding, active inference, and embodied cognition under one mathematical formalism. Friston shows that minimizing free energy is equivalent to maximizing model evidence (Bayesian inference) and can be implemented through gradient descent on prediction errors in hierarchical generative models.",
  "smoc_relevance_summary": "This paper is the direct source of SMoC's PURPOSE FIELD DYNAMICS equation: d\ud835\udcab/dt = -\u2207Incoherence(\ud835\udd6e). Friston's free energy F serves as the prototype for SMoC's incoherence measure. Just as biological systems minimize free energy (prediction error) through perception and action, code systems evolve to minimize incoherence through refactoring and documentation. The paper's central insight\u2014that self-organizing systems maintain identity by minimizing free energy\u2014translates directly to SMoC: code maintains coherence (identity as purposeful system) by reducing the gap between stated purpose and actual structure. Friston's hierarchical predictive coding maps to SMoC's 16-level scale hierarchy, where each level makes predictions about the level below and updates based on prediction errors. The paper's treatment of Markov blankets (statistical boundaries separating system from environment) provides the formal foundation for SMoC's context boundaries\u2014how we define where one module ends and another begins. Active inference (acting to confirm predictions rather than passively observing) parallels SMoC's Stone Tool principle: AI agents actively shape code to reduce their own uncertainty. Finally, Friston's gradient descent on free energy (F = -log p(data|model)) becomes SMoC's gradient descent on incoherence: \u2207Incoherence points toward architectural improvements.",

In SMoC, incoherence measures the difference between stated purpose (documentation, specs, names) and actual structure (graph, dependencies, implementations). The equation d\ud835\udcab/dt = -\u2207Incoherence is a direct translation: code evolves (d\ud835\udcab/dt) by following the gradient that reduces incoherence, just as organisms evolve to reduce free energy. Both are gradient descent processes on information-theoretic measures of misalignment between model and reality.",
