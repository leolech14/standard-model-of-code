  "summary": "Ashby's 'Introduction to Cybernetics' (1956) establishes cybernetics as the science of control and communication in animals and machines. The book introduces fundamental concepts: requisite variety (a regulator must have at least as much variety as the system it regulates), the good regulator theorem (every good regulator must be a model of the system), and homeostasis (self-regulation maintaining stability). Ashby develops these ideas through rigorous mathematical treatment of state spaces, transformations, and information flow, making cybernetics applicable across biology, engineering, and social systems.",
  "smoc_relevance_summary": "Ashby's requisite variety principle directly informs SMoC's approach to observability and analysis. To analyze code (regulate its quality), analysis tools must have sufficient variety (expressive power) to match code complexity. This explains why SMoC needs 167 atoms, 33 roles, 8 dimensions\u2014requisite variety to match real code's diversity. The good regulator theorem grounds SMoC's emphasis on models: Collider builds graph models of code because any tool that successfully regulates code quality must contain a model of that code. Documentation is literally a regulator (guides development)\u2014by Ashby's theorem, docs must model the system. Poor docs fail as regulators because they lack requisite variety (don't capture actual complexity).",

In SMoC: analysis tools must have expressive power matching code complexity. This justifies 167 atoms, 33 roles, 8 dimensions\u2014not arbitrary proliferation but necessary variety to regulate diverse code patterns. Static analyzers with low variety (simple pattern matching) can't regulate complex emergent properties; SMoC's rich ontology provides requisite variety.",

When regulation fails (bad docs, unmaintained comments), it's because the model diverged from reality\u2014violating Ashby's theorem.",
