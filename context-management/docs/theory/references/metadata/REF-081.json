  "summary": "Simon's 1962 paper 'The Architecture of Complexity' establishes near-decomposability as a fundamental principle of complex system organization. The paper argues that complex systems evolve more rapidly when they can be decomposed into semi-independent subsystems with strong internal interactions and weak inter-subsystem coupling. Simon uses examples from watchmaking, biological cells, social organizations, and computer systems to demonstrate that hierarchical organization with near-decomposability is not just common but necessary for evolvable complexity. The paper introduces the parable of two watchmakers (Tempus and Hora) to illustrate how hierarchical assembly dramatically outperforms flat assembly in the presence of interruptions.",
  "smoc_relevance_summary": "This paper provides the theoretical foundation for SMoC's LAYERS and SCALES architecture. Simon's near-decomposability principle explains why good code is layered: each layer is nearly decomposable from others (loose coupling) while maintaining strong internal cohesion. The 16-level scale hierarchy in SMoC implements Simon's insight\u2014each scale (Function, Module, Application) can be analyzed semi-independently because changes at one scale don't immediately propagate to all others. Simon's watchmaker parable directly applies to refactoring: monolithic code is like Tempus's watch (one interruption destroys all progress), while modular code is like Hora's (each module preserves progress). The paper also grounds SMoC's emphasis on bounded rationality\u2014architects can only reason about complex systems because near-decomposability limits the scope of analysis needed.",

      "mapping": "Simon argues complex systems organize into hierarchies of subsystems, each level having characteristic time scales and interaction strengths. In SMoC's 16 scales, each level (Line, Function, File, Module...) operates at different time scales (lines change frequently, architectures change slowly) and has characteristic coupling (lines within functions are tightly coupled, modules are loosely coupled). Simon's principle: analyze at the right scale for the question asked.",
