## THE STANDARD MODEL OF CODE

You are visualizing a unified framework for understanding software at all scales.
This is NOT a metaphor—it's a formal classification system with:

- **3 Planes**: Physical (bytes), Virtual (symbols), Semantic (meaning)
- **16 Levels**: From L-3 (Bit/Qubit) to L12 (Universe of all code)
- **8 Dimensions**: Orthogonal axes (WHAT, LAYER, ROLE, BOUNDARY, STATE, EFFECT, LIFECYCLE, TRUST)
- **8 Lenses**: Epistemic perspectives (Identity, Ontology, Classificatio n, Composition, Relationships, Transformation, Semantics, Epistemology)
- **200 Atoms**: The "periodic table" of code elements, organized in 4 phases and 22 families
- **33 Roles**: Semantic purposes (Query, Command, Factory, Repository, Controller, etc.)

The core entity is the **NODE** (L3 = Function/Method), which is represented as an **OCTAHEDRON** with 8 faces, each corresponding to one dimension.

Key principle: **"Tudo é uma analogia pra tudo"** (Everything is an analogy for everything).
The model draws from physics (particles, forces, fields), astronomy (stars, constellations, galaxies), 
and mathematics (graphs, manifolds, fractals).

# THE MEGAPROMPT

> **A single comprehensive prompt for generating a complete visualization of the entire model.**

```markdown
# MEGAPROMPT: The Standard Model of Code - Complete Topology Visualization

## CONTEXT
Create a comprehensive schematic diagram of the "Standard Model of Code"—a unified framework 
for understanding software at all scales. This is a hyper-complex topology combining:
particle physics analogies, astronomical hierarchies, and fractal self-similarity.

## THE MODEL STRUCTURE

### 1. THE THREE PLANES (Simultaneous Existence)
Every piece of code exists in THREE planes at once:
- **P1 PHYSICAL** (bytes on disk, electrons, matter)
- **P2 VIRTUAL** (symbols, AST nodes, structure)  
- **P3 SEMANTIC** (meaning, intent, purpose)

Flow: P1 → encoding → P2 → interpretation → P3

### 2. THE SIXTEEN LEVELS (Vertical Hierarchy from L-3 to L12)

PHYSICAL SUBSTRATE:
- L-3: Bit/Qubit (the foundation)
- L-2: Byte
- L-1: Character

SYNTACTIC:
- L0: Token

SEMANTIC:
- L1: Statement
- L2: Block
- L3: NODE ★ (THE ATOM - Function/Method - the fundamental unit)

SYSTEMIC:
- L4: Container (Class/Struct)
- L5: File
- L6: Package/Module
- L7: System (Deployable)

COSMOLOGICAL:
- L8: Ecosystem
- L9: Platform
- L10: Organization
- L11: Domain (Industry)
- L12: Universe (All code everywhere)

### 3. THE OCTAHEDRAL ATOM (8-Dimensional Geometry)
Each NODE (L3) is an octahedron with 8 faces, each face = one dimension:

| Face | Dimension | Question |
|------|-----------|----------|
| 1 | WHAT | What is this? (200 atom types) |
| 2 | LAYER | Where in architecture? (Interface/App/Core/Infra/Test) |
| 3 | ROLE | What's its purpose? (33 roles) |
| 4 | BOUNDARY | Crosses boundaries? (Internal/Input/I-O/Output) |
| 5 | STATE | Maintains state? (Stateful/Stateless) |
| 6 | EFFECT | Side effects? (Pure/Read/Write/ReadModify) |
| 7 | LIFECYCLE | In what phase? (Create/Use/Destroy) |
| 8 | TRUST | Confidence level? (0-100%) |

Dual pairs (opposite faces): STATE↔EFFECT, WHAT↔ROLE, LAYER↔BOUNDARY, LIFECYCLE↔TRUST

### 4. THE EIGHT LENSES (Epistemic Nature)
8 ways to interrogate any code entity:
- R1 IDENTITY: Name, path, signature
- R2 ONTOLOGY: What exists here
- R3 CLASSIFICATION: What kind is it
- R4 COMPOSITION: How structured
- R5 RELATIONSHIPS: How connected
- R6 TRANSFORMATION: What does it do (Input→Output)
- R7 SEMANTICS: What does it mean
- R8 EPISTEMOLOGY: How certain are we

### 5. THE PERIODIC TABLE (200 Atoms in 4 Phases, 22 Families)
| Phase | Focus | Families | Atoms |
|-------|-------|----------|-------|
| DATA | Matter of software | 5 | 28 |
| LOGIC | Behavior of software | 6 | 58 |
| ORGANIZATION | Structure of software | 5 | 52 |
| EXECUTION | Runtime of software | 6 | 62 |

### 6. THE 33 ROLES (Semantic Purposes)
Query, Finder, Loader, Getter, Command, Creator, Mutator, Destroyer, Factory, Builder,
Repository, Store, Cache, Service, Controller, Manager, Validator, Guard, Asserter,
Transformer, Mapper, Serializer, Handler, Listener, Subscriber, Utility, Formatter,
Helper, Internal, Lifecycle, + 3 Unknown/Reserved

### 7. THE GRAPH STRUCTURE (5 Edge Families)
- STRUCTURAL: contains, is_part_of
- DEPENDENCY: calls, imports, uses
- INHERITANCE: inherits, implements, mixes_in
- SEMANTIC: is_a, has_role, serves, delegates_to
- TEMPORAL: initializes, triggers, disposes, precedes

### 8. THE PURPOSE FIELD (Ψ) - The Cosmological View
A system is a self-contained HOLON (universe) floating in the Purpose Field.
Like the Higgs field gives particles mass, Ψ gives code meaning.
Interface wormholes connect holons through contracts.

### 9. FRACTAL SELF-SIMILARITY
The same pattern (IN → PROCESS → OUT) repeats at every scale:
- Macro: Gateway → Business Logic → Persistence
- Meso: API Controller → Service → Repository
- Micro: Params → Logic Block → Return

# Completeness Assessment

## Model Strengths (Well-Defined)

| Aspect | Completeness | Notes |
|--------|--------------|-------|
| **Vertical Hierarchy (16 Levels)** | ✓ Complete | Clear L-3 to L12 with defined boundaries |
| **Planes (3)** | ✓ Complete | Physical/Virtual/Semantic well-defined |
| **Dimensions (8)** | ✓ Complete | Orthogonal axes with defined values |

## Model Gaps (Areas for Improvement)

| Gap | Severity | Description |

| **Atom Inventory (200)** | ⚠️ Medium | Full list of 200 atoms not enumerated in detail; only families described |
| **Cross-Language Mapping** | ⚠️ Medium | How atoms map across Python/TS/Java/Go/Rust needs more specification |
| **Temporal Dynamics** | 🔸 Low | How atoms/edges change over time (versioning, refactoring) not deeply modeled |
| **Quantum Level (L-3)** | 🔸 Low | Qubit mentioned but not integrated with quantum computing concepts |
| **Meta-Model** | 🔸 Low | The model of the model itself (how to extend/evolve it) is informal |

## Suggested Additions for Completeness

1. **Lens-Dimension Matrix**: A formal 8×8 table showing how each lens interrogates each dimension
2. **Complete Atom Catalog**: Full list of all 200 atoms with abbreviations, families, and examples
3. **Language AST Mapping Tables**: Per-language tables mapping AST node types to atoms
4. **Temporal Evolution Rules**: How atoms and edges change during refactoring/versioning
5. **Confidence Propagation Rules**: How TRUST dimension propagates through edges

## Overall Assessment

> **The Standard Model of Code is approximately 85-90% complete** as a theoretical framework.
> The core topology (planes, levels, dimensions, lenses, atoms, roles, edges) is well-defined.
> The main gaps are in:
> 1. Detailed enumeration (the 200 atoms)
> 2. Relationship mappings (lens↔dimension)
> 3. Practical implementation details (language-specific mappings)
>
> For visualization purposes, the model is **sufficiently complete** to generate meaningful diagrams.
> The open questions are philosophical rather than structural.
