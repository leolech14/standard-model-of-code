# Legacy Schema Files (Dec 2025)

These files were archived on 2026-01-11 because they contained outdated information.

## What Was Outdated

| File | Issue |
|------|-------|
| `HIERARCHY.md` | 13 levels (L0-L12) - current model has 16 levels (L-3 to L12) |
| `GLOSSARY.md` | Same 13 levels issue + less detailed than THEORY.md |
| `theory_v2.0.md` | Superseded by docs/theory/THEORY.md (v3.0) |
| `theory_v2.md` | Duplicate of theory_v2.0.md |

## Canonical Sources (Current)

- **Theory**: `docs/theory/THEORY.md` (v3.0.0, Jan 7 2026)
- **Foundations**: `docs/theory/FOUNDATIONAL_THEORIES.md`
- **Additional**: `docs/theory/ADDITIONAL_THEORIES.md`
- **Markers**: `schema/MARKERS.md` (still active - tooling)

## What Was Preserved

The unique concepts from these files are already in THEORY.md:
- 3 Planes (Physical, Virtual, Semantic)
- 16 Levels (L-3 to L12) - CORRECTED from 13
- 8 Lenses
- 8 Dimensions
- 200 Atoms
- 33 Roles
- Edge taxonomy
- Confidence levels
- Name patterns

## Why Archived (Not Deleted)

These files represent the evolution of thought. They may contain:
- Historical context
- Alternative formulations that were later refined
- Details that could inform future work
