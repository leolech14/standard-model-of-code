# LOCAL-FIRST IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST
## Tactical Guide to HSL Reliability

---

## PHASE 1: DEBUG & ESTABLISH RELIABILITY (Weeks 1-2)

### Week 1: Debug HSL Exit Code 1

- [ ] **Day 1-2: Reproduce Failure**
  - [ ] Run HSL daemon locally with verbose logging
  - [ ] Capture exit code 1 consistently
  - [ ] Record full error message and stack trace
  - [ ] Attempt to reproduce on different machine (if possible)
  - [ ] Document reproduction steps precisely

- [ ] **Day 3: Add Comprehensive Logging**
  - [ ] Add logging at daemon startup
  - [ ] Add logging for each file watch event
  - [ ] Add logging for each event processing step
  - [ ] Add logging before daemon exits
  - [ ] Use structured logging (JSON or similar) for production
  - [ ] Ensure all errors include full context (file, line, state)

- [ ] **Day 4: Identify Root Cause**
  - [ ] Run with full logging
  - [ ] Identify exact line where failure occurs
  - [ ] Check for: missing dependencies, configuration errors, permission issues
  - [ ] Verify all assumptions (file paths exist, permissions correct, etc.)
  - [ ] Document root cause clearly

- [ ] **Day 5: Fix & Verify**
  - [ ] Implement fix for identified root cause
  - [ ] Run daemon continuously for 1 hour
  - [ ] Process >100 file events during test run
  - [ ] Verify exit code = 0 (success)
  - [ ] Commit fix with detailed message

### Week 1-2: Establish Health Metrics

- [ ] **Define Success Metrics**
  - [ ] File events processed within 100ms: Target/Actual
  - [ ] Confidence reports generated within 1 second: Target/Actual
  - [ ] Error rate < 0.1%: Target/Actual
  - [ ] Memory usage stable (no growth over 1 hour): Target/Actual
  - [ ] CPU usage proportional to file event rate: Target/Actual

- [ ] **Add Health Check Endpoint** (if daemon has HTTP interface)
  - [ ] `GET /health` returns JSON with metrics
  - [ ] Metrics include: uptime, events_processed, errors, memory_mb, cpu_percent
  - [ ] Health check passes if all metrics within acceptable range

- [ ] **Create Monitoring Dashboard** (local)
  - [ ] Real-time display of health metrics
  - [ ] Graph of file event processing rate
  - [ ] Graph of report generation latency
  - [ ] Alert thresholds for failures

### Week 2: Build Local Event Loop

- [ ] **File Watcher Implementation**
  - [ ] Watch directory: `src/` (or equivalent)
  - [ ] Detect events: add, change, delete
  - [ ] Handle edge cases: rapid changes, concurrent modifications, chunked writes
  - [ ] Publish events to local queue with unique ID

- [ ] **Event Stream (Local Queue)**
  - [ ] Queue system: Python multiprocessing.Queue OR asyncio.Queue OR Redis (local)
  - [ ] Event format: JSON with timestamp, file_path, event_type
  - [ ] Queue size: Monitor for backlog
  - [ ] Persistence: (Optional, but helpful for replay/debugging)

- [ ] **Confidence System Subscriber**
  - [ ] Subscribe to file events
  - [ ] Process asynchronously (non-blocking)
  - [ ] Publish ANALYSIS_COMPLETE events when done
  - [ ] Handle errors gracefully (retry, log, continue)

- [ ] **Report Generation**
  - [ ] Subscribe to ANALYSIS_COMPLETE events
  - [ ] Generate confidence reports
  - [ ] Store reports to disk with timestamp
  - [ ] Publish REPORT_GENERATED events for consumers

- [ ] **Event Loop Test**
  - [ ] Modify a file in watched directory
  - [ ] Verify: File event → Analysis → Report generated
  - [ ] Check latency end-to-end (target: <2 seconds)
  - [ ] Test rapid successive changes (target: handle 10+ per second)

---

## PHASE 2: ADD TESTING (Week 2-3)

### Unit Tests: Daemon Component

- [ ] **Test: File Watch Detection**
  ```python
  def test_file_watch_detects_add():
      # Create file in watched directory
      # Verify daemon detects add event within 100ms

  def test_file_watch_detects_change():
      # Modify file in watched directory
      # Verify daemon detects change event within 100ms

  def test_file_watch_detects_delete():
      # Delete file in watched directory
      # Verify daemon detects delete event within 100ms
  ```

- [ ] **Test: Event Publishing**
  ```python
  def test_event_has_unique_id():
      # Each event has unique identifier

  def test_event_has_timestamp():
      # Each event has timestamp

  def test_event_has_metadata():
      # Each event has file_path, event_type, etc.
  ```

- [ ] **Test: Error Handling**
  ```python
  def test_handles_permission_denied():
      # File watch continues even if permission denied

  def test_handles_broken_symlink():
      # File watch continues even if symlink broken

  def test_handles_rapid_changes():
      # File watch handles 10+ rapid changes correctly
  ```

### Integration Tests: Daemon + Confidence System

- [ ] **Test: End-to-End File → Report**
  ```python
  def test_file_change_generates_report():
      # 1. Modify file in watched directory
      # 2. Wait for analysis to complete
      # 3. Verify confidence report generated
      # 4. Check report contains correct analysis

  def test_multiple_files_processed_sequentially():
      # 1. Modify file A
      # 2. Wait for report A
      # 3. Modify file B
      # 4. Wait for report B
      # 5. Verify both reports correct
  ```

- [ ] **Test: Concurrent Processing**
  ```python
  def test_handles_concurrent_file_modifications():
      # 1. Modify file A and B simultaneously
      # 2. Verify both analyzed correctly
      # 3. Verify no race conditions
  ```

- [ ] **Test: Event Ordering**
  ```python
  def test_preserves_event_order():
      # 1. Generate 10 file events in sequence
      # 2. Verify processed in same order
      # 3. Verify no reordering
  ```

### Stress Tests: Load & Performance

- [ ] **Test: High File Event Rate**
  ```python
  def test_handles_1000_events_per_second():
      # Generate 1000 file events rapidly
      # Measure: latency, error rate, memory growth
      # Target: <2 second latency, 0 errors, stable memory
  ```

- [ ] **Test: Long-Running Stability**
  ```python
  def test_daemon_stable_for_1_hour():
      # Run daemon for 1 hour with continuous file events
      # Monitor: memory (should not grow), CPU (should be proportional)
      # Verify: zero crashes, zero hangs
  ```

- [ ] **Test: Recovery from Failure**
  ```python
  def test_recovers_after_confidence_crash():
      # 1. Run daemon + confidence system
      # 2. Kill confidence system process
      # 3. Verify daemon continues
      # 4. Restart confidence system
      # 5. Verify events queued during outage are processed
  ```

### Test Infrastructure

- [ ] **Create Test Directory Structure**
  ```

  │   └── confidence.conf
  ├── data/
  │   └── (analysis data goes here)
  └── logs/
      └── (structured logs)
  ```

  - [ ] Determine if differences are necessary
  - [ ] Update config management to eliminate unnecessary drift
  - [ ] Document necessary differences

### Performance Baseline in Staging

- [ ] **Measure Key Metrics**
  ```
  Metric                          | Dev | Staging | Target | Status
  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  File event processing latency   | 45ms | 50ms | <100ms  | ✓
  Report generation time          | 800ms | 850ms | <1000ms | ✓
  Memory usage (1 hour run)       | Stable | Stable | No growth | ✓
  Error rate                       | 0 | 0 | <0.1% | ✓
  ```

- [ ] **Test Staging→Production Readiness**
  - [ ] Staging config matches production exactly
  - [ ] Staging metrics pass all thresholds
